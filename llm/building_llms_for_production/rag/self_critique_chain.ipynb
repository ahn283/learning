      "The LangChain library is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle, including development and productionization. LangChain consists of open-source building blocks, components, and third-party integrations like LangGraph, LangServe, and LangSmith. It allows for building stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support. The LangChain library is part of a rich ecosystem of tools that integrate with the framework and build on top of it.\n",
