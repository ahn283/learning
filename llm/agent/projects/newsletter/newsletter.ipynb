Account creation paused after high demand of AI video generator\\nOpenAI used publicly available data, proprietary data from partners and human data to train Sora, a new video generator.\\nGreta Cross\\nUSA TODAY\\nA new artificial intelligence-driven video generator launched on Monday and due to high demand, it is temporarily unavailable to new users.\\nOn Monday, OpenAI, parent company of software like ChatGPT and photo generator DALL-E, launched Sora, an artificial intelligence video generator. The software allows users to create \"realistic videos\" from text, photos and other videos.\\nAs of Tuesday morning, new Sora accounts could not be created, due to an influx established on Monday.\\n\"We\\'re currently experiencing heavy traffic and have temporarily disabled Sora account creation,\" a pop-up message read on the Sora website. \"If you\\'ve never logged into Sora before, please check back again soon.\"\\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told USA TODAY on Tuesday that the company does not have specifics to share on the number of users who enrolled for Sora on Monday.\\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\\nLooking to learn more? Here\\'s what to know about Sora, OpenAI\\'s new video-generating software.\\nHow does Sora work?\\nSora is a diffusion model, meaning it \"generates a video by starting off with a base video that looks like static noise and gradually transforms it by removing the noise over many steps,\" according to OpenAI. Like DALL-E, Sora uses the \"recaptioning technique\" to take descriptive text captions for visual data training. As a result, the software is able to follow a user\\'s text instructions \"more faithfully.\"\\nSora can generate video from text instructions and existing images and video. For example, Sora is able to take an existing video and fill in missing parts or extend an ending that may not have previously been there.\\nAccording to OpenAI, Sora is capable of generating videos up to 1080p resolution in widescreen, vertical and square aspect ratios. Videos can be up to 20 seconds long.\\nHow did OpenAI \\'train\\' Sora?\\nAll artificial intelligence software must be \"trained\" in order to learn its function. According to OpenAI, publicly available data from the internet, non-public proprietary data from partners and human data (feedback from users) were used to train the video-generating software.\\nDownload USA TODAY\\'s app to get to the heart of news TikTok asks Supreme Court to review ban legislation, content creators react: What to know Apple, Android users on notice from FBI, CISA about texts amid \\'massive espionage campaign\\' Social media platform Bluesky nearing 25 million users in continued post-election growth Fortnite OG is back. Here\\'s what to know about the mode\\'s release, maps and game pass. Why won\\'t ChatGPT acknowledge the name David Mayer? Internet users uncover mystery\\nHow much does it cost to use Sora?\\nSora is only available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro members. A ChatGPT Plus membership is $20 per month and a Pro membership is $200 per month. Sora is also only available to adults 18 and up, according to OpenAI.\\nChatGPT Plus and Pro members can create up to 50 Sora-generated videos at 480p resolution each month or fewer videos at 720p resolution each month.\\nTake a look at early Sora videos\\nSora videos posted to X this week have ranged from video game-style point-of-views to surrealist artwork. Take a look at some of the early content shared:\\nHow OpenAI hopes to mitigate potential abuse\\nArtificial intelligence has long been criticized for how it can be abused, pointing to real-life examples like the\\xa0deepfake of President Joe Biden\\xa0telling Americans not to vote and\\xa0sexually explicit\\xa0AI-generated deepfake photos of\\xa0Taylor Swift.\\nOn its website, OpenAI says it understands these risks and has implemented safety mitigations. These include age gating access to adults 18 and up, restricting the use of likeness and face uploads, and \"having more conservative moderation thresholds on prompts and uploads of minors at launch.\"\\nAll Sora-generated videos will also come with C2PA metadata, which will identify the content as coming from the software, and visible watermarks, OpenAI states.\\nWhat is OpenAI?\\nLaunched in 2015 by tech moguls including Elon Musk, OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research organization. OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2019 and DALL-E in January 2021.\\nContributing: James Powell and Julia Gomez\\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

Brownlee got early access to Sora, and gave his initial impressions in a 15-minute review.\\nSora lives on Sora.com, Brownlee said, the homepage for which shows a scroll of recently-generated and OpenAI-curated Sora videos. (It hadn’t gone live for us here at TechCrunch as of publication time.) Notably, the tool isn’t built into ChatGPT, OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot platform. It appears to be its own separate product for now.\\nVideos on the Sora homepage can be bookmarked for later viewing to a “Saved” tab, organized into folders, and clicked on to see which text prompts were used to generate them. Sora can generate videos from uploaded images as well as prompts, according to Brownlee, and edit existing videos.\\nUsing the “Re-mix” feature, users can describe changes they want to see in a video and Sora will attempt to incorporate these in a newly-generated clip. Re-mix has a “strength” setting that lets users specify how drastically they want Sora to change a target video, with higher values yielding videos that take more liberties.\\nSora can generate up to 1080p footage, Brownlee says — but the higher the resolution, the longer videos take to generate. 1080p footage takes 8x longer than 480p, the fastest option, while 720p takes 4x longer.\\nA look a the Sora homepage. Image Credits:Marques Brownlee\\nBrownlee said that the average 1080p video took a “couple of minutes” to generate in his testing. “That’s also, like, right now, when almost no one else is using it,” he said. “I kind of wonder how much longer it’ll take when this is just open for anyone to use.”\\nIn addition to generating one-off clips, Sora has a “Storyboard” feature that lets users string together prompts to create a scene, Brownlee says. This is meant to help with consistency, presumably — a notorious weak point for video generators.\\nBut how’s Sora perform? Well, Brownlee says, it suffers from the same flaws as other tools out there, namely objects passing in front of each other or behind each other in ways that don’t make sense, or that disappear and reappear without reason.\\nLegs are another major source of problems for Sora, Brownlee says. Any time a person or animal with legs has to walk for a long while in a clip, Sora will confuse the front legs and back legs. The legs will “swap” back and forth, basically, in an anatomically impossible way.\\nSora’s terms of use. Image Credits:OpenAI\\nSora has a number of safeguards built in, Brownlee says, and prohibits creators from generating footage showing people under the age of 18, containing violence or “explicit themes,” and that’s under copyright belonging to another party. Sora also won’t generate videos from images with public figures, recognizable characters, or logos, Brownlee says, and it watermarks each video — albeit with a visual watermark that can be easily cropped out.\\nSo, what’s Sora good for? Brownlee found it to be useful for things like title slides in a certain style, animations, abstracts, and stop-motion footage. But he wouldn’t endorse it for anything photorealistic.\\n“It’s impressive that it’s AI-generated video, but you can tell pretty quickly that it’s AI-generated video,” he said of the majority of Sora’s clips. “Things just get really wonky.”\\nRead Full Story\\nDevamını oku : techcrunch.com\\n×\\nTechCrunch\\nOpenAI's Sora is launching tod ...\\nSHARE\\nMORE technology\\nTechCrunch 13 hour\\nBlue Yonder investigating data theft claims after ransomware gang takes credit for cyberattack\\nMashable 7 hour\\nGet the Sonos Move 2 for $90 less at Amazon\\nAdvertisement About Contact Terms of Use\\nPrivacy Policy © 2021 Bundle\"},\n",

The tool can also complete a scene and extend existing videos by filling in missing frames.\\nAdvertisement\\nRohan Sahai, Sora\\'s product lead, said a product team of about five or six engineers built the product in months.\\n\"Sora is a tool,\" Sora product designer Joey Flynn said. \"It allows you to be multiple places at once, try multiple ideas at once, try things that are entirely impossible before.\"\\nOpenAI showed off the new product and its various features during a Monday livestream with CEO Sam Altman.\\nAdvertisement\\nA screenshot of Sora\\'s Explore page for browsing AI videos from the community. OpenAI\\nSora includes an Explore page, a browsable feed of videos shared by the community. OpenAI also showed the various style presets available like pastel symmetry, film noir, and balloon world.\\nRelated stories\\nTo customize videos further, there\\'s also Storyboard, which lets users organize and edit sequences on a timeline. The feature helps pull together text prompts that Sora then builds into scenes.\\nThe company showed off Sora\\'s features, including Storyboard. screenshot/OpenAI\\nOpenAI previously made Sora available in February to a limited group of creators, including designers and filmmakers, to get feedback on the model.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe company said in its blog post when it launched that the product \"may struggle to simulate the physics of a complex scene,\" and may not understand cause and effect. It may also mix up left from right and struggle to depict events that happen over time, the company said in its blog post.\\nThe tool has already made a strong impression on some Hollywood members. Tyler Perry previously put his plans for an $800 million studio expansion on hold after seeing Sora. The billionaire entertainer referred to Sora demonstrations as \"shocking\" and said AI would likely reduce the need for large sets and traveling to locations for shoots.\\nHowever, the tool\\'s product designer clarified in the demonstration that Sora isn\\'t going to create feature films at the click of a button. Flynn said the tool is more \"an extension of the creator who\\'s behind it.\"\\nAdvertisement\\n\"If you come into Sora with the expectation that you\\'ll just be able to click a button and generate a feature film, I think you\\'re coming in with the wrong expectation,\" Sora product designer Flynn said.\\nThe team also briefly touched on safety issues. Sahai said during the presentation that OpenAI had a \"big target\" on its back, and the team wanted to prevent illegal activity while balancing creative expression with the new product.\\n\"We\\'re starting a little conservative and so if our moderation doesn\\'t quite get it right, just give us that feedback,\" Sahai said. \"We\\'ll be iterating.\"\\nAdvertisement\\nOpenAI said Sora is rolling out to the public in the US and many other countries on Monday. However, Altman said it will be \"a while\" before the tool rolls out in the UK and most of Europe.\\nChatGPT Plus subscribers who pay $20 monthly can get up to 50 generations per month of AI videos that are 5 seconds long with a resolution of 720p. ChatGPT Pro users who pay $200 a month get unlimited generations in the slow queue mode and 500 faster generations, Altman said in the demo. Pro users can generate up to 20-second long videos that are 1080p resolution, without watermarks.\\nWhile non-paying users can\\'t create Sora videos, they browse Sora\\'s Explore feed, Altman said.\\nAdvertisement\\nProminent YouTuber Marques Brownlee published what he described as the first-ever Sora review on Monday, telling his nearly 20 million subscribers that the results were both \"horrifying and inspiring.\"\\nAfter a brief overview of Sora\\'s strengths and weaknesses — the YouTuber said it can make provocative videos of cosmic events in deep space and other abstractions, but it struggles with realistic depictions of physics in day-to-day life, like a man running with a football — Brownlee was frank about his concerns.\\nMillions of people can now use Sora for basically whatever they want. And while the program has decent guardrails, one can be circumvented, he said. The little watermark that Sora adds to the bottom-right corner of its videos can be cropped out, Brownlee said.\\nAdvertisement\\n\"And it\\'s still an extremely powerful tool that directly moves us further into the era of not being able to believe anything you see online,\" he said, adding: \"This is a lot for humanity to digest right now.\"\\nRead next\\nOpenAI Sam Altman\\nAdvertisement\\nAdvertisement\\nRecommended video\\nAdvertisement\\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

       "   'raw_content': 'Sora Launches As OpenAI\\'s Game-Changer For AI Video Creation - The Pinnacle Gazette\\nToday : Dec 11, 2024\\nCorrections Contact Us\\nTHE PINNACLE GAZETTE BETA by Evrim Ağacı\\nHome\\nPolitics\\nWorld News\\nU.S. News\\nBusiness\\nSports\\nTechnology\\nHealth\\nArts & Culture\\nScience\\n+ More\\nPolitics\\nWorld News\\nU.S. News\\nBusiness\\nSports\\nTechnology\\nHealth\\nArts & Culture\\nScience\\nLocal News\\nClimate & Environment\\nEconomy\\nLifestyle\\nEducation\\nTravel\\nReal Estate\\nFood\\nObituaries\\nBooks\\nMultimedia\\nTechnology\\n11 December 2024\\nSora Launches As OpenAI\\'s Game-Changer For AI Video Creation\\nOpenAI unveils Sora, opening up innovative video generation to ChatGPT users, but concerns about ethical use loom.\\nOpenAI has officially launched Sora, its revolutionary AI video generator, during its highly anticipated \"12 Days of OpenAI\" event. This cutting-edge tool, which has been teased throughout the year, allows users to create realistic videos from simple text, photos, and even other videos. The release is seen as the latest step in OpenAI’s efforts to explore the frontiers of generative AI, especially following the explosive popularity and subsequent scrutiny of its text-based AI products like ChatGPT.\\nSora is not just another AI gimmick; it has the potential to reshape how we create and consume digital content. OpenAI’s mission with Sora, according to CEO Sam Altman, is to explore the possibilities of AI-driven video creation and to co-develop the necessary norms and safeguards to use this technology responsibly. \"Video is important to our culture,\" Altman stated during the launch, highlighting the significance of integrating video content more thoroughly within the realms of AI.\\nAt the moment, Sora is exclusively accessible to ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers, allowing for different levels of engagement based on the subscription tier. Plus subscribers can create up to 50 priority videos each month with limitations—specifically, each video is capped at 720p resolution and five seconds long. Meanwhile, the Pro tier offers significantly enhanced capabilities—500 priority videos, up to 1080p resolution, and longer video durations up to 20 seconds. This development emphasizes the value of upgrading to Pro for those serious about integrating AI-generated video content for professional or semi-professional use.\\nDuring its initial demonstration, Sora exhibited impressive capabilities, generating stunningly realistic videos based on user prompts. For example, one demo showed the creation of life-like scenes featuring animated characters interacting with their environments. Early reviews have praised Sora for its user-friendly interface, which includes tools for editing, timeline management, and the ability to upload and animate user-generated images. Such features position Sora as not just a tool for creating finished products but also as part of the creative process, allowing users to iterate and refine their ideas.\\nDespite its strengths, many artists and creators have raised concerns about the ethical implications of AI-generated content. Much like the backlash against text-based AI, there’s considerable anxiety surrounding the impact of video AI on existing careers and industries, particularly those involved in film, marketing, and broadcasting. Critics argue AI tools like Sora might undermine the integrity of creative professions, as businesses could opt for AI video generation over traditional methods, potentially devaluing human artistry.\\nOpenAI acknowledges these concerns, emphasizing its commitment to developing Sora with substantial safeguards. The system includes built-in limitations on the upload of recognizable individuals\\' likenesses, aimed at mitigating the risks of deepfakes and other potentially harmful content. Altman expressed the company\\'s aim to balance creativity and expression with the prevention of illegal activities—prioritizing safety as the technology evolves.\\nWhile Sora has garnered excitement, it also faces limitations. The platform often struggles with accurately depicting physical interactions and complex actions over longer durations, prompting OpenAI to restrict the length of generated videos to 20 seconds. Critics worry this cap may hinder the ability of users to create more cinematic content, which could limit the applicability of Sora for certain creative projects.\\nThis launch places OpenAI amid fierce competition with other tech giants venturing deep within generative AI. Google, for example, is developing its own video generation tools, hinting at rapidly growing interest across the industry to capture user-driven video content generation. With Sora now available to millions worldwide, the platform is likely to see both rapid uptake and scrutiny, as early users venture to test the boundaries of what AI-generated videos can achieve.\\nSo, what’s next for Sora? OpenAI is likely to build on early feedback from users and continue refining the platform, enhancing its features with additional functionalities and safety measures. This aligns with the company’s larger goal to pioneer AI technology responsibly, ensuring the benefits of artificial intelligence are enjoyed without disproportionate risks.\\nWhile it\\'s still early days, Sora\\'s rollout symbolizes the dawn of potentially limitless creativity powered by artificial intelligence. Just as platforms like TikTok and YouTube changed how audiences consume video, Sora could very well redefine video production itself, empowering individuals across various fields from casual creators to marketing professionals. All eyes will definitely be on how this pivotal technology develops and integrates itself in our increasingly digital lives.\\nLoved What You Read?

Photograph: Chona Kasinger/Bloomberg via Getty Images\\nArtificial intelligence (AI)\\nOpenAI makes AI video generator Sora publicly available in US\\nFirm announces tool that can create AI video clip based on user’s written prompts will be available to anyone in the US\\nDara Kerr\\nMon 9 Dec 2024 16.24 ESTLast modified on Mon 9 Dec 2024 16.50 EST\\nShare\\nAnyone in the US can now use OpenAI’s artificial intelligence video generator, Sora, which the company announced on Monday would become publicly available. OpenAI first presented Sora in February, but it was only accessible to select artists, film-makers and safety testers. At multiple points on Monday, though, OpenAI’s website did not allow for new sign-ups for Sora, citing heavy traffic.\\nSora is known as a text-to-video generator, a tool that can create AI video clips based on a user’s written prompts. An example on OpenAI’s website has the prompt of “a wide, serene shot of a family of woolly mammoths in an open desert”. Its video shows a group of three of the extinct creatures slowly walking through sand dunes.\\n“We hope this early version of Sora will enable people everywhere to explore new forms of creativity, tell their stories, and push the boundaries of what’s possible with video storytelling,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post.\\nOpenAI is known for its popular chatbot ChatGPT, but it has been branching into other forms of generative AI. It is working on a voice-cloning tool and has integrated an image generation tool, Dall-E, into ChatGPT’s functions. The Microsoft-backed company leads the burgeoning AI market and is now valued at nearly $160bn.\\nBefore today’s release of Sora, OpenAI let the tech reviewer Marques Brownlee test the tool. He said the results were “horrifying and inspiring at the same time”. Brownlee said Sora did well with landscapes and stylistic effects but that it struggled to realistically depict basic physics. Some film-makers who were also given a preview said the tool produced strange visual defects.\\nSora: OpenAI launches tool that instantly creates video from text Read more\\nIt is understood that OpenAI is still working through compliance issues with the Online Safety Act in the UK and the Digital Services Act and GDPR in the EU.\\nTwo weeks ago, the company suspended any access to the tool when a group of artists created a backdoor that would allow anyone to use it. In a statement posted to the AI community site Hugging Face, they accused OpenAI of “art washing” a product that would steal the livelihood of artists like them. The “Sora PR Puppets”, as they dubbed themselves, said the company was trying to spin a positive narrative for its product by associating with creative people.\\nWhile generative AI has improved considerably over the past year, it is still prone to hallucinations, or incorrect responses, and plagiarism. AI image generators also often produce unrealistic images, such as people with several arms or misplaced facial features.\\nCritics warn that this type of AI video technology could be misused by bad actors for disinformation, scams and deepfakes. There have already been deepfake videos of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, supposedly calling for a ceasefire and of Kamala Harris supposedly describing herself as “the ultimate diversity hire”.\\nskip past newsletter promotion\\nSign up to TechScape\\nFree weekly newsletter\\nA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives\\nEnter your email address\\nSign up\\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company said that it was additionally “blocking particularly damaging forms of abuse, such as child sexual abuse materials and sexual deepfakes”.\\nSora will be available to users who already subscribe and pay for OpenAI’s tools.

This innovative tool allows users to create videos simply by typing text prompts, marking a significant advancement in AI technology. Available on Sora.com, Sora offers numerous features and capabilities for creating realistic videos, and its public release has ignited excitement across creative industries.\\nInitially revealed to select users back and tested this past February, OpenAI gradually rolled out access to Sora, quickly gathering feedback from early adopters. Following months of anticipation, the company announced its public availability on Monday, along with the introduction of the \"Sora Turbo\" model, promising significantly faster processing times than its predecessor. This upgrade certainly caught the attention of the tech-savvy audience eager to witness the future of video content creation.\\nOpenAI\\'s Sora operates under the same generative AI principles as text-to-image models. At its core, Sora leverages advanced algorithms to translate written instructions directly to video content, turning words on the screen to visual storytelling. Users can generate videos lasting up to 20 seconds and at resolutions of 720p to 1080p, depending on their subscription level.\\nThe service is available primarily for subscribers of ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) and ChatGPT Pro ($200/month). While the Plus version allows users to generate shorter videos with lower resolution, the Pro plan features expanded capabilities, such as longer videos, enhanced resolution, and even the option to download videos without watermarks. OpenAI is also offering the ability to upload personal assets to customize and remix generated videos.\\nDuring the livestreamed event on launch day, OpenAI\\'s CEO, Sam Altman, showcased Sora’s various functionalities, including the \"Explore\" page, which allows users to browse community-shared videos. The interface is user-friendly and mimics storyboarding, providing creators with the ability to organize and control their video content more efficiently.\\nDespite the innovative features, OpenAI has been transparent about the limitations of the Sora model. According to the company, Sora sometimes struggles with realism—especially when it involves complex actions or simulating physics accurately. The technology is still developing, and as it stands, videos generated may not always meet professional-grade standards.\\nSecurity and ethical usage were also major themes during OpenAI\\'s presentations. The company has taken precautions to address potential misuse, implementing safeguards such as the C2PA metadata embedded within videos, which helps viewers verify their origins. Sora is programmed to block content associated with illegal activities and harmful representations, such as child abuse and deepfake pornography. These preventive measures highlight the responsibility OpenAI recognizes as leaders within the AI industry.\\nIndustry leaders are already taking note of Sora’s potential. Content creators like Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) have described their initial experiences with the tool as both \"horrifying and inspiring.\" His insights suggest users are beginning to explore creative boundaries, albeit with caution about the consequences of such powerful AI tools becoming widely accessible.\\nCreative professionals are considering Sora\\'s capacities for practical applications. For example, Tyler Perry emphasized the way tools like Sora could potentially alter the future of production, noting AI\\'s ability to minimize the need for large sets and on-location shooting. Already, some creators are brainstorming how to utilize Sora for everything from marketing campaigns to entirely new storytelling modes.\\nWith Sora now available, discussions around the ethical frameworks governing its usage are gaining traction. OpenAI is open to community feedback, hoping users will contribute insights and recommendations to help refine the model\\'s safety and usability protocols. During the launch, Rohan Sahai, Sora’s product lead, indicated the team’s commitment to ensuring the technology is not only innovative but also socially responsible.\\nFor those eager to try their hand at AI video creation, Sora is the perfect tool to explore new creative avenues. Although it might not replace traditional filmmaking just yet, its potential for enhancing creativity and efficiency could reshape how videos are produced and experienced. OpenAI\\'s foray with Sora stands as yet another chapter in the ever-evolving story of AI technology, showcasing the possibilities as it strides forward.\\nAvailable on numerous platforms, Sora offers exciting directions for video content creation.

Brownlee got early access to Sora, and gave his initial impressions in a 15-minute review.\\nSora lives on Sora.com, Brownlee said, the homepage for which shows a scroll of recently-generated and OpenAI-curated Sora videos. (It hadn’t gone live for us here at TechCrunch as of publication time.) Notably, the tool isn’t built into ChatGPT, OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot platform. It appears to be its own separate product for now.\\nVideos on the Sora homepage can be bookmarked for later viewing to a “Saved” tab, organized into folders, and clicked on to see which text prompts were used to generate them. Sora can generate videos from uploaded images as well as prompts, according to Brownlee, and edit existing videos.\\nUsing the “Re-mix” feature, users can describe changes they want to see in a video and Sora will attempt to incorporate these in a newly-generated clip. Re-mix has a “strength” setting that lets users specify how drastically they want Sora to change a target video, with higher values yielding videos that take more liberties.\\nSora can generate up to 1080p footage, Brownlee says — but the higher the resolution, the longer videos take to generate. 1080p footage takes 8x longer than 480p, the fastest option, while 720p takes 4x longer.\\nA look a the Sora homepage. Image Credits:Marques Brownlee\\nBrownlee said that the average 1080p video took a “couple of minutes” to generate in his testing. “That’s also, like, right now, when almost no one else is using it,” he said. “I kind of wonder how much longer it’ll take when this is just open for anyone to use.”\\nIn addition to generating one-off clips, Sora has a “Storyboard” feature that lets users string together prompts to create a scene, Brownlee says. This is meant to help with consistency, presumably — a notorious weak point for video generators.\\nBut how’s Sora perform? Well, Brownlee says, it suffers from the same flaws as other tools out there, namely objects passing in front of each other or behind each other in ways that don’t make sense, or that disappear and reappear without reason.\\nLegs are another major source of problems for Sora, Brownlee says. Any time a person or animal with legs has to walk for a long while in a clip, Sora will confuse the front legs and back legs. The legs will “swap” back and forth, basically, in an anatomically impossible way.\\nSora’s terms of use. Image Credits:OpenAI\\nSora has a number of safeguards built in, Brownlee says, and prohibits creators from generating footage showing people under the age of 18, containing violence or “explicit themes,” and that’s under copyright belonging to another party. Sora also won’t generate videos from images with public figures, recognizable characters, or logos, Brownlee says, and it watermarks each video — albeit with a visual watermark that can be easily cropped out.\\nSo, what’s Sora good for? Brownlee found it to be useful for things like title slides in a certain style, animations, abstracts, and stop-motion footage. But he wouldn’t endorse it for anything photorealistic.\\n“It’s impressive that it’s AI-generated video, but you can tell pretty quickly that it’s AI-generated video,” he said of the majority of Sora’s clips. “Things just get really wonky.”\\nRead Full Story\\nDevamını oku : techcrunch.com\\n×\\nTechCrunch\\nOpenAI's Sora is launching tod ...\\nSHARE\\nMORE technology\\nTechCrunch 13 hour\\nBlue Yonder investigating data theft claims after ransomware gang takes credit for cyberattack\\nMashable 7 hour\\nGet the Sonos Move 2 for $90 less at Amazon\\nAdvertisement About Contact Terms of Use\\nPrivacy Policy © 2021 Bundle\"},\n",

For example, users could type in descriptions, such as “a stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street,” and Sora would provide up to 60-second videos based on that information. Workers feared that it was a prelude to a future in which AI displaced jobs throughout Hollywood.\\nBut until now, Sora has been available only to people participating in research, testing and previews for artists.\\nAdvertisement\\nOn Monday, Sora faces its next big test as OpenAI, best known for the ChatGPT text bot, makes it available to the broader public. In the U.S., consumers can use Sora with a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month. It can generate up to 50 videos of up to 20 seconds long. Customers can get more Sora usage, higher resolution and longer videos with a ChatGPT Pro subscription.\\nOpenAI executives say Sora will lead to new possibilities for artists and creatives.\\n“We really believe that Sora can open doors for people to explore and share their creativity visually, especially without extensive resources or training,” said Souki Mansoor, Sora artist program lead for OpenAI, in an interview. “As we know, filmmaking is very expensive.”\\nHollywood Inc.\\nWashed Out’s new music video was created with AI. Is it a watershed moment for Sora?\\nWashed Out is the first major music artist to commission a music video using OpenAI’s Sora text-to-video technology.\\nMay 2, 2024\\nThe tool will be accessible for people 18 or older where ChatGPT is available, except for in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and countries in the European Economic Area. OpenAI said it is working on enabling Sora in those locations. The company is also preparing a free version of Sora.\\nAdvertisement\\nAI is a major source of tension in the entertainment industry. It was a key issue in last year’s strikes by actors and writers, who sought protections from the rising tech as part of their contract negotiations.\\nMany have also raised concerns about how AI models are trained and whether intellectual property rights holders and artists are being compensated fairly, or at all, for content digested by the powerful technology.\\nEntertainment companies meanwhile have been exploring partnerships with AI startups as a way to save money.\\nAdvertisement\\nMansoor said that OpenAI is sensitive to the concerns raised by creatives about potential job losses, but is optimistic about the opportunities.\\n“Sora is designed as a creative collaborator, so the hope is that it helps artists bring very ambitious projects to life without expensive resources,” Mansoor said. “We think that this is raising the bar for what’s possible in video creation.”\\nHollywood Inc.\\nWe went to a gala for AI-produced movies. Here’s what we saw\\nA behind the scenes look at a film gala held in San Francisco that screened movies made with artificial intelligence.\\nSept. 26, 2024\\nSora’s proponents say it could help artists test bold ideas without as many budget constraints. Alexia Adana, a New York-based creative director and visual artist, made the case that it could enable more stories from people, including underrepresented creators, who lack financial resources or equipment.\\n“We’re in this age where you can create anything and you can learn anything, and it’s either free or very low cost,” said Adana, who had early access to Sora. “This is such an exciting time for people who wouldn’t normally have the resources to demonstrate their vision.”\\nAdana used Sora to create a film concept called “Bloomchild,” which depicted a child made of soil and dirt who blooms and struggles to fit in. She said it was influenced by her own experiences as a person from Jamaica who grew up in the suburbs of Connecticut.\\n“I’m able to use a tool to come up with a full-on trailer,” Adana said. “I would have never been able to do that before.”\\nAdvertisement\\nIndie pop artist Washed Out used Sora to create a music video. The director said the tool allowed him to show scenes from multiple places at a fraction of the cost of shooting on location. Meanwhile, a video that explained the origins of Toys R Us was made 80% with Sora, said Nik Kleverov, chief creative officer of Native Foreign, a Culver City-based creative agency and production company.\\nHollywood Inc.\\nAI is supposed to be Hollywood’s next big thing. What’s taking so long?\\nAs AI technology advances, industry observers expect to see more deals between tech companies and studios and talent. But major challenges remain.\\nOct. 17, 2024\\nOpenAI said Sora will have safety measures in place to prevent abuses of the tool, such as child nudity.\\nRohan Sahai, Sora’s engineering lead, said OpenAI has done “a lot of safety work to better understand how we prevent misuse” since Sora was first announced in February.\\nSome artists are angry with how OpenAI has gone about testing and developing Sora. Last month, a group of artists posted concerns in an online letter about how many creators, in their view, are being used to test and promote the technology without adequate compensation.\\nThe open letter has received more than 1,170 signatures, including from London artist Jake Elwes.\\n“While hundreds contribute for free, a select few will be chosen through a competition to have their Sora-created films screened — offering minimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives,” the artists wrote.\\nAdvertisement\\nMansoor said that the group’s comments had no influence on the timing of Sora’s launch. She said that the company focused on giving early access to artists who would be most disrupted by tools like Sora and give them the option of helping shape the tool’s development.\\n“There was no obligation to even use the tool, much less give feedback,” she said.\\nMansoor said she came from the creative industry, spending more than a decade in independent filmmaking. “I came to OpenAI to create the kinds of experiences that I wish I had coming up in the industry,” she said.\\nKleverov said the concerns raised by the letter didn’t reflect the views of early testers. “The AI world is already so small and then within the world, those of us who are playing with Sora — it’s such a supportive space,” he said.\\nWalter Woodman, a director and co-founder of Toronto and L.A. production company Shy Kids, said once people experience Sora, “then everyone will see that it is not a magic bullet.” Shy Kids has used Sora to work on short films including “My Love.”\\nMany creators who have used AI tools say it takes time to get the hang of the tools and that the technology has important limitations.\\n“Sora can help, much like a camera, editing equipment, or great performance,” Woodman said in an email. “But without great storytelling and storytellers, it will be just a tool on the shelf. However, those with talent are in for a creative awakening.”\\nMore to Read\\nColumn: OpenAI just scored a huge victory in a copyright case ... or did it?\\nNov. 13, 2024\\nAI startup funding hit a record in the L.A. area last quarter.

This cutting-edge tool, which has been teased throughout the year, allows users to create realistic videos from simple text, photos, and even other videos. The release is seen as the latest step in OpenAI’s efforts to explore the frontiers of generative AI, especially following the explosive popularity and subsequent scrutiny of its text-based AI products like ChatGPT.\\nSora is not just another AI gimmick; it has the potential to reshape how we create and consume digital content. OpenAI’s mission with Sora, according to CEO Sam Altman, is to explore the possibilities of AI-driven video creation and to co-develop the necessary norms and safeguards to use this technology responsibly. \"Video is important to our culture,\" Altman stated during the launch, highlighting the significance of integrating video content more thoroughly within the realms of AI.\\nAt the moment, Sora is exclusively accessible to ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers, allowing for different levels of engagement based on the subscription tier. Plus subscribers can create up to 50 priority videos each month with limitations—specifically, each video is capped at 720p resolution and five seconds long. Meanwhile, the Pro tier offers significantly enhanced capabilities—500 priority videos, up to 1080p resolution, and longer video durations up to 20 seconds. This development emphasizes the value of upgrading to Pro for those serious about integrating AI-generated video content for professional or semi-professional use.\\nDuring its initial demonstration, Sora exhibited impressive capabilities, generating stunningly realistic videos based on user prompts. For example, one demo showed the creation of life-like scenes featuring animated characters interacting with their environments. Early reviews have praised Sora for its user-friendly interface, which includes tools for editing, timeline management, and the ability to upload and animate user-generated images. Such features position Sora as not just a tool for creating finished products but also as part of the creative process, allowing users to iterate and refine their ideas.\\nDespite its strengths, many artists and creators have raised concerns about the ethical implications of AI-generated content. Much like the backlash against text-based AI, there’s considerable anxiety surrounding the impact of video AI on existing careers and industries, particularly those involved in film, marketing, and broadcasting. Critics argue AI tools like Sora might undermine the integrity of creative professions, as businesses could opt for AI video generation over traditional methods, potentially devaluing human artistry.\\nOpenAI acknowledges these concerns, emphasizing its commitment to developing Sora with substantial safeguards. The system includes built-in limitations on the upload of recognizable individuals\\' likenesses, aimed at mitigating the risks of deepfakes and other potentially harmful content. Altman expressed the company\\'s aim to balance creativity and expression with the prevention of illegal activities—prioritizing safety as the technology evolves.\\nWhile Sora has garnered excitement, it also faces limitations. The platform often struggles with accurately depicting physical interactions and complex actions over longer durations, prompting OpenAI to restrict the length of generated videos to 20 seconds. Critics worry this cap may hinder the ability of users to create more cinematic content, which could limit the applicability of Sora for certain creative projects.\\nThis launch places OpenAI amid fierce competition with other tech giants venturing deep within generative AI. Google, for example, is developing its own video generation tools, hinting at rapidly growing interest across the industry to capture user-driven video content generation. With Sora now available to millions worldwide, the platform is likely to see both rapid uptake and scrutiny, as early users venture to test the boundaries of what AI-generated videos can achieve.\\nSo, what’s next for Sora? OpenAI is likely to build on early feedback from users and continue refining the platform, enhancing its features with additional functionalities and safety measures. This aligns with the company’s larger goal to pioneer AI technology responsibly, ensuring the benefits of artificial intelligence are enjoyed without disproportionate risks.\\nWhile it\\'s still early days, Sora\\'s rollout symbolizes the dawn of potentially limitless creativity powered by artificial intelligence. Just as platforms like TikTok and YouTube changed how audiences consume video, Sora could very well redefine video production itself, empowering individuals across various fields from casual creators to marketing professionals. All eyes will definitely be on how this pivotal technology develops and integrates itself in our increasingly digital lives.\\nLoved What You Read?

This innovative tool allows users to create videos simply by typing text prompts, marking a significant advancement in AI technology. Available on Sora.com, Sora offers numerous features and capabilities for creating realistic videos, and its public release has ignited excitement across creative industries.\\nInitially revealed to select users back and tested this past February, OpenAI gradually rolled out access to Sora, quickly gathering feedback from early adopters. Following months of anticipation, the company announced its public availability on Monday, along with the introduction of the \"Sora Turbo\" model, promising significantly faster processing times than its predecessor. This upgrade certainly caught the attention of the tech-savvy audience eager to witness the future of video content creation.\\nOpenAI\\'s Sora operates under the same generative AI principles as text-to-image models. At its core, Sora leverages advanced algorithms to translate written instructions directly to video content, turning words on the screen to visual storytelling. Users can generate videos lasting up to 20 seconds and at resolutions of 720p to 1080p, depending on their subscription level.\\nThe service is available primarily for subscribers of ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) and ChatGPT Pro ($200/month). While the Plus version allows users to generate shorter videos with lower resolution, the Pro plan features expanded capabilities, such as longer videos, enhanced resolution, and even the option to download videos without watermarks. OpenAI is also offering the ability to upload personal assets to customize and remix generated videos.\\nDuring the livestreamed event on launch day, OpenAI\\'s CEO, Sam Altman, showcased Sora’s various functionalities, including the \"Explore\" page, which allows users to browse community-shared videos. The interface is user-friendly and mimics storyboarding, providing creators with the ability to organize and control their video content more efficiently.\\nDespite the innovative features, OpenAI has been transparent about the limitations of the Sora model. According to the company, Sora sometimes struggles with realism—especially when it involves complex actions or simulating physics accurately. The technology is still developing, and as it stands, videos generated may not always meet professional-grade standards.\\nSecurity and ethical usage were also major themes during OpenAI\\'s presentations. The company has taken precautions to address potential misuse, implementing safeguards such as the C2PA metadata embedded within videos, which helps viewers verify their origins. Sora is programmed to block content associated with illegal activities and harmful representations, such as child abuse and deepfake pornography. These preventive measures highlight the responsibility OpenAI recognizes as leaders within the AI industry.\\nIndustry leaders are already taking note of Sora’s potential. Content creators like Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) have described their initial experiences with the tool as both \"horrifying and inspiring.\" His insights suggest users are beginning to explore creative boundaries, albeit with caution about the consequences of such powerful AI tools becoming widely accessible.\\nCreative professionals are considering Sora\\'s capacities for practical applications. For example, Tyler Perry emphasized the way tools like Sora could potentially alter the future of production, noting AI\\'s ability to minimize the need for large sets and on-location shooting. Already, some creators are brainstorming how to utilize Sora for everything from marketing campaigns to entirely new storytelling modes.\\nWith Sora now available, discussions around the ethical frameworks governing its usage are gaining traction. OpenAI is open to community feedback, hoping users will contribute insights and recommendations to help refine the model\\'s safety and usability protocols. During the launch, Rohan Sahai, Sora’s product lead, indicated the team’s commitment to ensuring the technology is not only innovative but also socially responsible.\\nFor those eager to try their hand at AI video creation, Sora is the perfect tool to explore new creative avenues. Although it might not replace traditional filmmaking just yet, its potential for enhancing creativity and efficiency could reshape how videos are produced and experienced. OpenAI\\'s foray with Sora stands as yet another chapter in the ever-evolving story of AI technology, showcasing the possibilities as it strides forward.\\nAvailable on numerous platforms, Sora offers exciting directions for video content creation. Users are encouraged to experiment and see how they can leverage the AI’s capabilities to push boundaries. Given the rapid pace of innovation, it’s anyone\\'s guess what the future holds as more creators embrace these tools to tell their stories and share their messages creatively.\\nOpenAI\\'s Sora is more than just another tech development; it\\'s fostering conversations about creativity, ethics, and future possibilities, reminding us of AI’s powerful place at the intersection of technology and art.\\nLoved What You Read?

       "   'raw_content': 'Advertisement\\nWhile hype envelops OpenAI’s genAI video platform Sora, some warn against commercial use\\nDecember 11, 2024 | 12 min read\\nListen to article\\n4 min\\nSome say Sora will supercharge marketing and commercial creativity. Others are less convinced.\\nWhile some marketers are bullish on Sora\\'s commercial potential, others are saying, \"Not so fast.\" / Adobe Stock\\nAs part of its ‘ship-mas’ product push ahead of the holidays, ChatGPT parent OpenAI on Monday released Sora, its highly anticipated video-generation platform, which was previously available only to a select group of testers.\\nIt’s a launch that some experts believe could greatly disrupt commercial creativity.\\nAfter iterating for a number of months, OpenAI has developed an enhanced version of the tool, dubbed Sora Turbo, available now via Sora.com for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users in the US and some other markets. Sora Turbo promises faster video creation capabilities, enabling users to produce realistic, 1080p resolution videos that are up to 20 seconds long from text prompts. The model supports a variety of aspect ratios and allows users to customize content with their own assets or create entirely new visuals.\\nThe product also includes a ‘storyboard tool’ that gives users the ability to more precisely tailor each frame in a video. Plus, community-driven feeds are rolling out within the platform to showcase user-generated content.\\n“We hope this early version of Sora will enable people everywhere to explore new forms of creativity, tell their stories, and push the boundaries of what’s possible with video storytelling,” the company said in a blog post announcing the release.\\nThe company said that Sora Turbo is “much faster” than the preview of Sora released to limited users in February, and noted that the team is working to make the tool more affordable in the future.\\nThe company also addressed growing concerns about transparency and disclosures around AI-generated content. It explained that Sora-made videos include C2PA metadata as well as visible, by-default watermarks. Plus, the company has built an internal search function that uses technical parameters to identify a video’s provenance. All of these features can, in theory, be used to determine whether a video was developed via Sora, helping to tamp down on the spread of misinformation online and potentially mitigate intellectual property disputes.\\nOpenAI has also implemented content guardrails on Sora – blocked content includes child sexual abuse materials and sexual deepfakes.\\nSora is not yet available in the UK or most of Europe.\\nThe believers make their case\\nExperts in marketing, production and communications are somewhat divided on the degree to which Sora might unseat traditional creative development.\\nAt minimum, the tool’s capabilities appear to have evolved beyond what was showcased in a highly ridiculed Toys R Us ad in June.\\nAnd some are extremely bullish on its potential.\\n“Sora is transforming how we approach commercial creativity and marketing,” says Nikola Baldikov, founder and CEO at Inbound Blogging, an SEO-focused content firm. “It’s making high-quality content creation more accessible than ever. It cuts out the need for expensive pre-production processes and professional equipment, which opens doors for smaller brands and creators who didn’t have the resources before.”\\nThe sentiment is echoed by Dev Nag, CEO of support automation firm QueryPal, who says, “Just as stock photography transformed print advertising decades ago, Sora and similar AI video tools will make high-quality video content creation more accessible and dramatically faster – and because creators can generate exactly what they envision rather than searching through existing assets, the creative possibilities expand exponentially.”\\nAdvertisement\\nNag expects that ongoing improvements to Sora’s capabilities will have long-term implications for the economics and operations of advertising and marketing. For now, he says, we’re entering a “first wave,” where we’ll see streamlined day-to-day production of assets like social media ads and product demos.\\nBut in his perspective, the rapid clip at which AI capabilities are advancing “suggests that any current technical limitations will largely disappear within 18 to 24 months” – meaning that, before long, we’ll hit a “second wave.” This era, he predicts, will see expanded use cases for video-generation technologies like Sora. “Creatives and agencies [will] start leveraging this technology as a creative partner, rapidly prototyping ideas and exploring creative directions at unprecedented speed and scale,” he says.\\nBut Sora’s capabilities may not just reshape how creative teams work – but could also reshape creative teams themselves. Baldikov expects that streamlined ideation and drafting could free teams up to focus more on high-level storytelling and strategy – but it could also replace jobs. “If tasks like concept visualization and quick content drafts can now be done in minutes, you simply don\\'t need to have a large team to perform them,” he says.\\nThe skeptic’s view\\nThough Sora’s arrival comes with much fanfare, competing in an increasingly crowded generative AI landscape won’t necessarily be a cakewalk.\\nA handful of other text-to-video models have already established themselves as formidable competitors. Chief among them is Runway. Known for its seamless integration with creative workflows, high-quality outputs and emphasis on artistic freedom, Runway has also positioned itself as a tool for creative professionals like filmmakers and designers.\\nAnd some experts believe OpenAI has, in some ways, already missed a critical window of opportunity to inspire Sora adoption among entertainment, production and advertising shops.\\n“The ‘prosumer’ and ‘pro’ user segments include film studios, advertising agencies, VFX and animation studios – all of these are already being served well by companies like Runway, which has large customers across all these segments,” says Sanja Partalo, co-founder and general partner at S4S Ventures, which invests in companies at the intersection or marketing, advertising and media. She also flags Autodesk-owned Wonder Dynamics as a leader in generative animation.\\nAdvertisement\\nBut beyond the competitive market of text-to-video generation, Sora may still suffer technical limitations. Beta users noted earlier this year that, despite the sophisticated imagery, the model ran into visual missteps common in AI-generated imagery and videos – sometimes failing to depict hands with the correct number of fingers, for example.\\nThough OpenAI has been working for months to smooth out technical issues like these, the company acknowledged in its blog post yesterday that the product remains imperfect. “The version of Sora we are deploying has many limitations,” OpenAI wrote. “It often generates unrealistic physics and struggles with complex actions over long durations.”\\nSome marketers remain unconvinced by any technical advancements that Sora may have made in the months since it was released in beta. “Sora is great for bogus, bastardized, nonsensical, dreamlike sequences,” says Bernard Meyer, senior director of creative and communications at Omnisend, an e-commerce and email marketing firm.\\nSpeaking more generally, Meyer suggests that AI-generated video tends to fall short when it comes to “creating visual consistency,” and says that humans can frequently pinpoint these visual inconsistencies. “When even the smallest detail is ‘off,’ we can spot it and it will distract us from the focus or purpose of the video,” he says.\\nTechnical limitations aside, Sora-made videos may fall flat for want of greater cultural context and human emotion, says Daria Shevchenko, CMO at Snov.io, which helps firms automate their marketing efforts. In her view, no amount of technical innovation will translate seamlessly into “content that will resonate with real people.” She says, “Only people know how to do that.”\\nWeighing the legal and ethical landmines\\nSora’s rollout has also sparked concerns over legal and ethical issues that could complicate its widespread adoption. Key concerns include its potential impact on copyright, asset protection and regulatory compliance, particularly as it becomes more integrated into commercial and creative industries.\\nCatch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.\\nStay up to date with a curated digest of the most important marketing stories and expert insights from our global team.\\nLearn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum.\\nWhile Sora may represent a breakthrough in AI-generated content, it shines a spotlight on consumers’ and lawmakers’ growing concerns about authenticity, provenance and intellectual property rights, says Alon Yamin, the co-founder and CEO of Copyleaks, an AI-based text analysis platform. He advocates for “proper regulations, tools and… best practices that safeguard authenticity and ensure ethical use.”\\nOpenAI has not disclosed the specific datasets used to train Sora, but like many other consumer-facing generative AI models, it’s probable that the program was trained on a vast range of publicly available information, which may include work in the public domain, copyrighted materials and other sources. The possibility that the model was trained on copyrighted work creates potential legal pitfalls for users and for OpenAI.\\nBrian Sanford, the creative editor and director of post-production at Versus, a production studio, partook in the artist beta, and has had extended access to Sora for the past six months. While he’s been somewhat impressed by the ability to generate longer videos and the visual fidelity of the end product, he remains skeptical about the system’s training. And ultimately, Sanford sees this as a prohibitive hurdle. “Without a clear understanding” of how Sora was trained, he says, “it will be difficult to deploy the system in commercial production.”\\nThe notion is echoed by Terri Walter, managing director of B2B marketing platform SalientMG, who says that Sora is still “far from being a tool we would recommend for commercial use cases.”\\nShe argues that Sora falls short in terms of asset protection and proper governance, making it a potential liability for marketers and advertisers. She urges the industry to keep an eye on OpenAI’s governance practices and remain vigilant in complying with data privacy regulations like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and the UK’s Online Safety Act.\\nWalter also suggests that advertisers and marketers get involved in novel standards-setting efforts like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (CP2A) – founded in 2021 by a cohort including Adobe, BBC, Intel and Microsoft – which aims to establish an open-access technical standard for verifying a piece of content’s origins and authenticity. Deployed in combination with developer-led efforts – like digital watermarks – such standards can help establish critical ethical protections for AI-generated content.\\nSora-generated videos come with CP2A metadata by default – meaning that their provenance should always be identifiable on the web.\\nToday, the need for effective authenticity and provenance verification is growing, evidenced by an explosion of AI-generated misinformation this year – from realistic faux images of young hurricane survivors to a Soviet-era-inspired image portraying Kamala Harris as a communist.\\nExperts remain divided on the extent to which Sora will revolutionize marketing and commercial creativity, but one thing is clear: the influx of AI-generated video in the industry and in the world comes with a plethora of legal and ethical quandaries yet to be fully addressed.\\nShortly after its public launch on Monday, OpenAI barred new Sora signups due to high demand.\\nFor more, sign up for The Drum’s daily newsletter here.\\nMore from Artificial Intelligence\\nMarketing can change the world.\\n© Carnyx Group Ltd 2024 | The Drum is a Registered Trademark and property of Carnyx Group Limited.

This release was announced live on Monday by CEO Sam Altman during the eleven-day \"12 Days of OpenAI\" livestream event. Starting today, Sora is accessible to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users across various regions, except the UK and certain European nations.\\nSora, which began its life as a beta product last February, allows users to generate digital videos from written prompts, creating clips of up to 20 seconds. The public interest had been building ever since OpenAI teased early demos of this technology, which showcased its remarkable photorealistic details and sophisticated physics. Nevertheless, the launch was not without controversy. Concerns arose surrounding the usage of content as it is reported Sora was trained on over a million hours of compiled YouTube videos. Critics argue this training method was somewhat unethical, as it likely included content without the consent or compensation of the original creators.\\nProtests from artists surfaced during the testing phase, with some early testers leaking API credentials to voice their dissent. They accused OpenAI of \"art washing,\" referring to the idea of using technology to exploit artistic efforts without fair attribution. Despite these concerns, OpenAI\\'s representatives stressed during the livestream the purpose of Sora was to empower creators rather than replace them. Product Lead Rohan Sahai articulated: \"Sora is not just another tool; it’s meant to be used alongside the creator’s vision to bring their ideas to life.\"\\nAccessible through its own website, sora.com, users can explore videos created by others and check out the various methods employed to create each video. For generating their own content, users can provide simple texts, images, or even employ the storyboarding tool, which allows for more complex construction of video sequences. The interface is user-friendly, featuring options to select aspect ratios, resolutions of up to 1080p, and varying durations, all of which cater to the needs of both amateur creators and professional videographers alike.\\nOne of the more advanced features of Sora, dubbed Storyboard, allows users to craft videos with precise instructions. It\\'s reminiscent of traditional video editing software, providing frame views and numerous editing tools at the creator\\'s fingertips. Each card or frame can be generated from text input or image uploads, with functionalities to rearrange scenes, remix, loop videos, or blend transitions between multiple shots.\\nRegarding existing safety measures, OpenAI promises transparency and security with Sora-generated videos. All videos come with C2PA invisible watermarks, along with visible watermarks by default. The feature limits the uploading of people and prohibits potentially harmful content, such as child exploitation material and explicit deepfakes. They claim this is all part of their commitment to ethical AI use.\\nUsers holding ChatGPT Plus subscriptions will have allowance for 50 videos per month at 480p resolution (or 720p for fewer videos). For those on the Pro plan, the usage limit increases significantly. This rollout has sparked considerable excitement, as creators begin to explore the capabilities of AI-driven video production.\\nYet, with great power can come substantial responsibility. Critics remain vigilant, noting the potential misuse of AI video generation technology. Past incidents involving deepfake technology remind users of the fine line between creativity and unethical practice. Indeed, there have been instances where AI-generated fakes have been used to spread misinformation or create inappropriate content, such as the infamous deepfake video featuring President Joe Biden.\\nGoing forward, OpenAI emphasizes its dedication to refining safeguards against the misuse of this technology, stating: \"Our approach prioritizes preventing damaging forms of misuse, including child sexual exploitation material (CSAM) and sexual deepfakes. We have implemented stringent measures to monitor and filter uploads and will report any identified threats to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.”\\nOpenAI\\'s well-acknowledged commitment to safeguarding against harmful content adds another layer of complexity to the introduction of Sora. With user-generated media, the stakes are higher than ever, and the imperative for responsible usage continues to grow. OpenAI appears to be positioning itself not just as a creator of technology but as a steward guiding the ethical boundaries around its usage.\\nThe excitement surrounding Sora\\'s public release is palpable, and many anticipate the possibilities this new tool will bring. From marketers seeking engaging content to educators fostering creativity among students, the applications for Sora could be extensive and varied. Altman proclaimed during the livestream, \"We want the world of AI to go beyond text. The integration of video brings another dimension to how the AI interacts with and enhances the human experience.\"\\nWhile Sora’s launch may herald exciting times for creators, it also prompts society to ponder the broader ramifications of artificial intelligence and these capabilities. The creators, advocates, and policymakers must engage thoroughly with the rapid development of AI technologies like Sora. This dialogue will be necessary to navigate the intersection of innovation and ethical responsibility, ensuring the technology is imbued with purpose and never misused.\\nLooking to the future, OpenAI plans to continue refining Sora and even relaxing certain restrictions on uploads as it hones its deepfake mitigation techniques. The potential for stunning creativity exists, balancing ingenuity with ethical constraints. The society\\'s engagement with these tools will shape what becomes possible and how responsibly they can be used. It’s clear—this isn’t just the beginning for Sora, but perhaps the dawn of new narratives forged through AI-powered video innovation.\\nLoved What You Read?

       "   'raw_content': 'ADVERTISEMENT\\nOpenAI to Release Long-Anticipated Sora Video Generator\\n(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI is rolling out an artificial intelligence system called Sora that can generate realistic-looking videos from text prompts, nearly 10 months after the startup first publicly previewed the technology.\\nSora will be available to paid users of chatbot ChatGPT in the US and other markets on Monday, the company said in a livestreamed presentation. The new version of the tool will be able to churn out videos up to 20 seconds in length and offer multiple variations of those clips.\\nWith Sora, OpenAI is working to keep pace with a growing number of startups that now offer tools to spit out short clips quickly and more cheaply than creating video from scratch — potentially upending the livelihoods of many in Hollywood. The list of rival AI video companies includes Pika, Haiper and Runway, the last of which recently partnered with a studio to train a new AI model and explore how the technology can be used in film production.\\nAfter OpenAI teased Sora in February, the ChatGPT maker began courting film studios, media executives and talent agencies in a series of meetings. OpenAI also granted access to a number of artists, as well as a few big-name actors and directors, to try out the service.\\nEarly on, Sora had clear constraints, however. In an early test, Bloomberg News found Sora struggled with stray body parts and a mixed understanding of physics. It also required noticeably more time — and computing power — to generate each video than users might be accustomed to with an image generator or chatbot.\\nInitially, at least, Sora’s availability will still be limited. Those who pay $20 per month for a ChatGPT Plus subscription will be able to generate 50 videos monthly, said OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman. Users who pay $200 per month for a ChatGPT Pro subscription will have unlimited access to “slower” generations, he said, and 500 videos created at a faster speed.\\nTo start, Sora also won’t be available in most of Europe, which has tougher tech regulations.\\nDuring the demonstration Monday, OpenAI showed off Sora’s new features. The tool can produce videos from still images and videos as well as text prompts, the company said. For instance, a user could upload a video clip and the software will spit out footage to lengthen it.\\nSora also includes an option called Storyboard, which allows people to write out what they want to happen at different points in a video to better direct a sequence of clips. And there’s an option to explore a feed of videos created by other users.\\nThis week’s announcement came as part of what OpenAI has said will be 12 days of livestreamed product events. On Thursday, OpenAI kicked off the launch series by introducing the more expensive new ChatGPT Pro option, with unlimited access to its most powerful AI models.\\n(Adds details on new version of Sora starting in second paragraph.)\\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n©2024 BellMedia All Rights Reserved\\nAccessibility & Feedback\\nAbout Bell Media\\nOther Brands\\nAutres Marques'}],\n",

It uses OpenAI’s name, but says OpenAI is not an investor. Originally legally controlled by OpenAI cofounder and CEO Sam Altman, it has raised money from outside LPs, including Microsoft, a big OpenAI backer, and “other OpenAI partners,” according to its web site. Altman gave up legal control to general partner Ian Hathaway earlier this year.\\nVCs typically use SPVs to pool money from investors and invest outside their main fund. However, the Fund is staying quiet about exactly what these funds are for.\\nA spokesman from OpenAI told TechCrunch that this SPV “will be used to support a variety of existing portfolio companies and to make new investments.”\\n“SPVs allow us to allocate capital to high-potential investments opportunistically.”\\nThe Fund, founded in 2021, has been on a real SPV streak this year, disclosing five separate vehicles that now total $114.2m:\\nSPV I, January 2024: $10,000,000\\nSPV II, April 2024: $24,999,947 (first disclosed as $15m, later amended)\\nSPV III, May 2024: $5,000,000 (as covered by TechCrunch)\\nSPV IV, July 2024: $29,916,411\\nSPV V, Dec 2024: $44,281,693\\nTC Sessions: AI\\nJoin 1,200 tech leaders for a full day of main-stage sessions, breakouts and networking at TechCrunch Sessions: AI.

Notable investments this year include include Thrive Health, an AI health venture between Sam Altman and Ariana Huffington, and warm outbound startup Unify.\\nThe fund is also a seed investor in Anysphere, which is currently in the middle of a VC bidding war thanks to its AI code assistant Cursor.\\nThese SPVs are all on top of the Fund’s original capital of $175.25m, which was raised back in October 2021.\\nTopics\\nAI, Exclusive, OpenAI, Startups, Venture, venture\\nOctober 27-29, 2025\\nSan Francisco\\nDisrupt 2025 will be here before you know it! 10,000 tech and VC leaders, 250+ speakers, 200+ sessions.

(Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\\nKey Facts\\nxAI recently raised nearly $6 billion in equity financing, according to a\\xa0filing\\xa0submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission by xAI CFO Jared Birchall, who is also the CEO of the Musk-founded neurotechnology company Neuralink.\\nA total of 97 investors contributed to the financing, though the filing did not specify who—previous investors included Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity and Saudi conglomerate holding company Kingdom Holding in xAI’s\\xa0Series B funding round\\xa0of $6 billion that ended in May.\\nThe equity financing comes not long after xAI raised more than $5 billion in a funding round that ended in November and valued the company at $50 billion, according to\\xa0The Wall Street Journal, more than doubling the $24 billion valuation it posted in its Series B.\\nThe funding reported by the Journal will reportedly be used in part to buy 100,000 Nvidia chips used to train AI models, one of several ways xAI plans to beef up its operations as it takes on competitors like OpenAI, Google, Meta and Anthropic.\\nxAI is still developing itself as a large player in the AI market, leaning on the computing power headquartered at its supercomputer site and recently telling investors it reached\\xa0$100 million in revenue\\xa0on an annualized basis—meanwhile, OpenAI expects\\xa0$3.7 billion in annual sales\\xa0this year.\\nxAI’s $50 billion valuation rivals Anthropic as the startup reportedly seeks a\\xa0$40 billion valuation—though OpenAI is positioned well beyond its competitors, boasting a\\xa0$157 billion valuation\\xa0amid\\xa0record-setting\\xa0weekly active users numbering 300 million.\\nWhat To Watch For\\nMusk, who has said he plans to double the size of his startup’s AI training cluster, also recently greenlit the addition of at least 1 million graphics processing units to xAI’s multibillion-dollar supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee (the additional GPUs can be used to train AI models and scale up the supercomputer’s workload). The supercomputer will be crucial in further developing xAI’s main product, a chatbot known as Grok that is available to users on X, formerly known as Twitter. The AI tool will soon be available through its own standalone app similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Journal reported.\\nChief Critics\\nThe rapid construction and expansion of xAI’s supercomputer has drawn criticism from multiple members of the Memphis City Council and environmental activists. Councilmember Rhonda Logan told Forbes this summer the council needed more time to understand the impacts of the facility housing and powering the supercomputer, blasting what’s been criticized as a quiet decision-making process about the facility’s construction that allegedly left councilmembers out of important discussions. Councilmember Pearl Walker told Forbes her constituents were concerned about the supercomputer’s impact on their local energy supply and water. The Memphis Community Against Pollution said in a statement the city “must consider how an industry using such a tremendous amount of energy will further impact communities already overwhelmed with pollution and a high energy burden, such as those around the xAI facility in southwest Memphis.”\\nForbes Valuation\\nWe estimate Musk’s net worth at $354.2 billion, making him the world’s wealthiest person, ahead of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($240.8 billion) and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison ($236.1 billion).\\nBig Number\\n122 days. That is how long it took to construct the xAI supercomputer in Memphis, according to booming chip designer Nvidia, which helped build the facility.\\nKey Background\\nxAI was established in 2023 by Musk, who was previously a co-founder and board member of OpenAI and would go on to position xAI as a direct competitor to the AI firm he helped create. Musk had disagreements with OpenAI about its for-profit structure and control of its board, though he has primarily cited conflicts of interest with Tesla’s AI work as his main reason for leaving. Although xAI showed up to the AI race a bit later than its contemporaries, the company has grown fast, taking advantage of being able to train its AI models with data from X and Tesla while also boasting serious AI training power driven by its “Colossus” supercomputer in Memphis. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during The New York Times DealBook Summit this week he assumes xAI will “be a really serious competitor,” lauding how quickly Musk’s company built its supercomputer.\\nThis story was originally published on\\xa0forbes.com\\xa0and all figures are in USD.\\nMore from Forbes Australia\\nCloud companies like Oracle, Amazon and Microsoft would lose millions to a TikTok ban\\nBy Emily Baker-White\\nForbes Staff\\nHomegrown Gilmour Space launching first rocket from Aus in 50 years\\nBy Shivaune Field\\nBusiness Journalist\\nEuropean AI unicorn pivots to launch fleet of killer drones\\nBy Iain Martin\\nBy Antonio Pequeño IV\\nTopics: AIBusinessElon MuskTechnologyxAI\\nAsides\\nSections\\nNews\\nEvents\\nLists\\nLife\\nCompany\\nAbout us\\nContact us\\nCareers\\nAdvertise with us\\nMedia\\nExplore\\nBillionaires\\nEntrepreneurs\\nInnovation\\nLeadership\\nSocial\\nFacebook\\nLinkedIn\\nInstagram\\nTwitter\\nYouTube\\nMagazines covers\\nGet the magazine delivered with a Premium membership, find it at all good newsagents, or purchase previous issues online.\\n© 2024 Success Publishing Pty Ltd including content reproduced under license from Forbes IP (HK) LTD.

(Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\\nNurPhoto via Getty Images\\nKey Facts\\nxAI recently raised nearly $6 billion in equity financing, according to a filing submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission by xAI CFO Jared Birchall, who is also the CEO of the Musk-founded neurotechnology company Neuralink.\\nA total of 97 investors contributed to the financing, though the filing did not specify who—previous investors included Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity and Saudi conglomerate holding company Kingdom Holding in xAI’s Series B funding round of $6 billion that ended in May.\\nThe equity financing comes not long after xAI raised more than $5 billion in a funding round that ended in November and valued the company at $50 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal, more than doubling the $24 billion valuation it posted in its Series B.\\nThe funding reported by the Journal will reportedly be used in part to buy 100,000 Nvidia chips used to train AI models, one of several ways xAI plans to beef up its operations as it takes on competitors like OpenAI, Google, Meta and Anthropic.\\nxAI is still developing itself as a large player in the AI market, leaning on the computing power headquartered at its supercomputer site and recently telling investors it reached $100 million in revenue on an annualized basis—meanwhile, OpenAI expects $3.7 billion in annual sales this year.\\nxAI’s $50 billion valuation rivals Anthropic as the startup reportedly seeks a $40 billion valuation—though OpenAI is positioned well beyond its competitors, boasting a $157 billion valuation amid record-setting weekly active users numbering 300 million.\\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\\nWhat To Watch For\\nMusk, who has said he plans to double the size of his startup’s AI training cluster, also recently greenlit the addition of at least 1 million graphics processing units to xAI’s multibillion-dollar supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee (the additional GPUs can be used to train AI models and scale up the supercomputer’s workload). The supercomputer will be crucial in further developing xAI’s main product, a chatbot known as Grok that is available to users on X, formerly known as Twitter. The AI tool will soon be available through its own standalone app similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the Journal reported.\\nChief Critics\\nThe rapid construction and expansion of xAI’s supercomputer has drawn criticism from multiple members of the Memphis City Council and environmental activists. Councilmember Rhonda Logan told Forbes this summer the council needed more time to understand the impacts of the facility housing and powering the supercomputer, blasting what’s been criticized as a quiet decision-making process about the facility’s construction that allegedly left councilmembers out of important discussions. Councilmember Pearl Walker told Forbes her constituents were concerned about the supercomputer’s impact on their local energy supply and water. The Memphis Community Against Pollution said in a statement the city “must consider how an industry using such a tremendous amount of energy will further impact communities already overwhelmed with pollution and a high energy burden, such as those around the xAI facility in southwest Memphis.”\\nForbes Valuation\\nWe estimate Musk’s net worth at $354.2 billion, making him the world’s wealthiest person, ahead of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($240.8 billion) and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison ($236.1 billion).\\nBig Number\\n122 days. That is how long it took to construct the xAI supercomputer in Memphis, according to booming chip designer Nvidia, which helped build the facility.\\nKey Background\\nxAI was established in 2023 by Musk, who was previously a co-founder and board member of OpenAI and would go on to position xAI as a direct competitor to the AI firm he helped create. Musk had disagreements with OpenAI about its for-profit structure and control of its board, though he has primarily cited conflicts of interest with Tesla’s AI work as his main reason for leaving. Although xAI showed up to the AI race a bit later than its contemporaries, the company has grown fast, taking advantage of being able to train its AI models with data from X and Tesla while also boasting serious AI training power driven by its “Colossus” supercomputer in Memphis. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during The New York Times DealBook Summit this week he assumes xAI will “be a really serious competitor,” lauding how quickly Musk’s company built its supercomputer.\\nFurther Reading\\nInside Elon Musk’s Mad Dash To Build A Giant xAI Supercomputer In Memphis (Forbes)\\nElon Musk’s Mad Dash To Build A Giant xAI Supercomputer In Memphis (Forbes)\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter\\xa0or\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Send me a secure\\xa0tip.\\nAntonio Pequeño IV\\nFollowing\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\nOne Community.

Initially forming their alliance back in 2019, the collaboration aimed to leverage Microsoft's expansive cloud computing capabilities with OpenAI's groundbreaking research and technologies.\\nSince then, the relationship has blossomed and evolved. Each step taken has been punctuated by significant financial investments, with Microsoft committing over $13 billion to support OpenAI. This hefty investment has fueled OpenAI's ambitions, pushing it to the forefront of the AI sector and allowing it to innovate at unprecedented speeds.\\nOne of the most remarkable advancements from this partnership has been the development of ChatGPT technology. This conversational AI tool has not only changed the way users interact with technology but also revolutionized how businesses approach customer service. Companies are now equipped to utilize advanced AI systems to streamline their operations, making them more efficient and user-friendly.\\nAfter the launch of ChatGPT, the world’s eyes were opened to the potential applications of AI. Within months of its release, organizations across various industries scrambled to integrate similar technologies. The hype surrounding AI surged, but it was clear to industry experts and insiders alike—the foundations were laid by the OpenAI-Microsoft partnership.\\nBut, like any high-stakes game, there have been challenges. Early concerns about transparency and the ethics surrounding AI deployment have surfaced repeatedly. Some critics argue the tech giants may be moving too fast without properly considering the broader societal impacts. OpenAI’s decision to potentially drop its commitment to artificial general intelligence (AGI) clauses, aimed at ensuring safety and ethical standards, has provoked discussions surrounding future investments and innovations.\\nRecent developments hint at OpenAI's eagerness to attract more investment by revising such agreements. This move could significantly alter the underlying dynamics of the partnership with Microsoft. By dropping the AGI clause, OpenAI appears willing to ease investor concerns about long-term risks associated with developing powerful AI technologies.\\nExperts speculate how this pivot may affect future innovation. The industry watches closely as the balance between ethical AI development and rapid technological advancements shifts. Could this be seen as OpenAI prioritizing swift funding over the conscientious development of truly intelligent systems? Some believe proper oversight is still possible, even amid fiscal pressures.\\nMeanwhile, Microsoft’s ambitions have been set high. The tech giant is positioning itself as the leader in AI integration across systems and has set its vision on having AI operate seamlessly within its applications. This is evident through its strategies, including incorporating AI features within popular software like Microsoft Office.\\nEnhancements to tools like Word and Excel, alongside ChatGPT capabilities like generating text, summarizing documents, and analyzing data, mark the initial steps toward creating more intuitive experiences for users. This could mean users will soon find themselves working alongside ‘intelligent’ assistants, forever shifting traditional workflows.\\nStepping beyond mere applications, there is talk of broader integration with Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing service. By providing developers with AI tools and infrastructure, they can roll out new applications faster and more efficiently. The endless possibilities of AI are now being made more accessible, thanks to this strategic partnership.\\nAnalysts remain optimistic about the future of the OpenAI-Microsoft collaboration. Investment continues to be funneled, and both companies are exploring new avenues for growth. There is speculation about potential mergers or acquisitions, buoyed by the overwhelming demand for AI solutions.\\nYet, this optimism is tempered by the recognition of the potential pitfalls of rushing development. The belief is prevalent among industry experts to strike the correct balance between innovation and ethical safeguards. OpenAI must tread carefully to avoid the pitfalls of unrestrained competition and decision-making.\\nLooking toward the future, the success of this partnership will likely hinge on the ability of both companies to navigate the fine line between ambitious advancements and responsible development. Observers can expect more major shifts and turning points between OpenAI and Microsoft as they continue to chart their course through the ever-changing tech sector.\\nLoved What You Read?

OpenAI said the voice was not an imitation of Johansson and that the company used a different voice actress.\\nConneau, along with WaveForms AI cofounder Coralie Lemaitre, said the startup will use the funding to train new audio AI models that solve the problem of making voice conversation with an AI bot feel indistinguishable from a human. He added that audio is the key to making AI interactions feel \"deeply human.\"\\n\"Audio ... conveys emotions and provides emotional responses back to users,\" he said.\\nConneau said the company plans to build a consumer software product that will focus on the emotional connection between the user and the AI, but declined to provide more details.\\n\"The idea is to create new, more immersive experiences with AI, ones that feel more enjoyable,\" he told Reuters. \"There are many companies right now that are focusing on superintelligence, but not so much on the quality of the human-computer interaction.\"\\nAmericasReuters\\nLogin or create a forever free account to read this news\\nLet\\'s go\\nAnalyze on Supercharts\\nRealtime news\\nMore realtime news\\nMore news from Reuters\\nMore news\\nLove in every #TradingView\\n90M+\\nTraders and investors use our platform.\\n1\\nTop website in the world when it comes to all things investing.\\n1.5M+\\nMobile reviews with 4.9 average rating.

This cutting-edge tool, which has been teased throughout the year, allows users to create realistic videos from simple text, photos, and even other videos. The release is seen as the latest step in OpenAI’s efforts to explore the frontiers of generative AI, especially following the explosive popularity and subsequent scrutiny of its text-based AI products like ChatGPT.\\nSora is not just another AI gimmick; it has the potential to reshape how we create and consume digital content. OpenAI’s mission with Sora, according to CEO Sam Altman, is to explore the possibilities of AI-driven video creation and to co-develop the necessary norms and safeguards to use this technology responsibly. \"Video is important to our culture,\" Altman stated during the launch, highlighting the significance of integrating video content more thoroughly within the realms of AI.\\nAt the moment, Sora is exclusively accessible to ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers, allowing for different levels of engagement based on the subscription tier. Plus subscribers can create up to 50 priority videos each month with limitations—specifically, each video is capped at 720p resolution and five seconds long. Meanwhile, the Pro tier offers significantly enhanced capabilities—500 priority videos, up to 1080p resolution, and longer video durations up to 20 seconds. This development emphasizes the value of upgrading to Pro for those serious about integrating AI-generated video content for professional or semi-professional use.\\nDuring its initial demonstration, Sora exhibited impressive capabilities, generating stunningly realistic videos based on user prompts. For example, one demo showed the creation of life-like scenes featuring animated characters interacting with their environments. Early reviews have praised Sora for its user-friendly interface, which includes tools for editing, timeline management, and the ability to upload and animate user-generated images. Such features position Sora as not just a tool for creating finished products but also as part of the creative process, allowing users to iterate and refine their ideas.\\nDespite its strengths, many artists and creators have raised concerns about the ethical implications of AI-generated content. Much like the backlash against text-based AI, there’s considerable anxiety surrounding the impact of video AI on existing careers and industries, particularly those involved in film, marketing, and broadcasting. Critics argue AI tools like Sora might undermine the integrity of creative professions, as businesses could opt for AI video generation over traditional methods, potentially devaluing human artistry.\\nOpenAI acknowledges these concerns, emphasizing its commitment to developing Sora with substantial safeguards. The system includes built-in limitations on the upload of recognizable individuals\\' likenesses, aimed at mitigating the risks of deepfakes and other potentially harmful content. Altman expressed the company\\'s aim to balance creativity and expression with the prevention of illegal activities—prioritizing safety as the technology evolves.\\nWhile Sora has garnered excitement, it also faces limitations. The platform often struggles with accurately depicting physical interactions and complex actions over longer durations, prompting OpenAI to restrict the length of generated videos to 20 seconds. Critics worry this cap may hinder the ability of users to create more cinematic content, which could limit the applicability of Sora for certain creative projects.\\nThis launch places OpenAI amid fierce competition with other tech giants venturing deep within generative AI. Google, for example, is developing its own video generation tools, hinting at rapidly growing interest across the industry to capture user-driven video content generation. With Sora now available to millions worldwide, the platform is likely to see both rapid uptake and scrutiny, as early users venture to test the boundaries of what AI-generated videos can achieve.\\nSo, what’s next for Sora? OpenAI is likely to build on early feedback from users and continue refining the platform, enhancing its features with additional functionalities and safety measures. This aligns with the company’s larger goal to pioneer AI technology responsibly, ensuring the benefits of artificial intelligence are enjoyed without disproportionate risks.\\nWhile it\\'s still early days, Sora\\'s rollout symbolizes the dawn of potentially limitless creativity powered by artificial intelligence. Just as platforms like TikTok and YouTube changed how audiences consume video, Sora could very well redefine video production itself, empowering individuals across various fields from casual creators to marketing professionals. All eyes will definitely be on how this pivotal technology develops and integrates itself in our increasingly digital lives.\\nLoved What You Read?

       "   'raw_content': 'ADVERTISEMENT\\nOpenAI to Release Long-Anticipated Sora Video Generator\\n(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI is rolling out an artificial intelligence system called Sora that can generate realistic-looking videos from text prompts, nearly 10 months after the startup first publicly previewed the technology.\\nSora will be available to paid users of chatbot ChatGPT in the US and other markets on Monday, the company said in a livestreamed presentation. The new version of the tool will be able to churn out videos up to 20 seconds in length and offer multiple variations of those clips.\\nWith Sora, OpenAI is working to keep pace with a growing number of startups that now offer tools to spit out short clips quickly and more cheaply than creating video from scratch — potentially upending the livelihoods of many in Hollywood. The list of rival AI video companies includes Pika, Haiper and Runway, the last of which recently partnered with a studio to train a new AI model and explore how the technology can be used in film production.\\nAfter OpenAI teased Sora in February, the ChatGPT maker began courting film studios, media executives and talent agencies in a series of meetings. OpenAI also granted access to a number of artists, as well as a few big-name actors and directors, to try out the service.\\nEarly on, Sora had clear constraints, however. In an early test, Bloomberg News found Sora struggled with stray body parts and a mixed understanding of physics. It also required noticeably more time — and computing power — to generate each video than users might be accustomed to with an image generator or chatbot.\\nInitially, at least, Sora’s availability will still be limited. Those who pay $20 per month for a ChatGPT Plus subscription will be able to generate 50 videos monthly, said OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman. Users who pay $200 per month for a ChatGPT Pro subscription will have unlimited access to “slower” generations, he said, and 500 videos created at a faster speed.\\nTo start, Sora also won’t be available in most of Europe, which has tougher tech regulations.\\nDuring the demonstration Monday, OpenAI showed off Sora’s new features. The tool can produce videos from still images and videos as well as text prompts, the company said. For instance, a user could upload a video clip and the software will spit out footage to lengthen it.\\nSora also includes an option called Storyboard, which allows people to write out what they want to happen at different points in a video to better direct a sequence of clips. And there’s an option to explore a feed of videos created by other users.\\nThis week’s announcement came as part of what OpenAI has said will be 12 days of livestreamed product events. On Thursday, OpenAI kicked off the launch series by introducing the more expensive new ChatGPT Pro option, with unlimited access to its most powerful AI models.\\n(Adds details on new version of Sora starting in second paragraph.)\\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n©2024 BellMedia All Rights Reserved\\nAccessibility & Feedback\\nAbout Bell Media\\nOther Brands\\nAutres Marques'},\n",

For example, users could type in descriptions, such as “a stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street,” and Sora would provide up to 60-second videos based on that information. Workers feared that it was a prelude to a future in which AI displaced jobs throughout Hollywood.\\nBut until now, Sora has been available only to people participating in research, testing and previews for artists.\\nAdvertisement\\nOn Monday, Sora faces its next big test as OpenAI, best known for the ChatGPT text bot, makes it available to the broader public. In the U.S., consumers can use Sora with a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month. It can generate up to 50 videos of up to 20 seconds long. Customers can get more Sora usage, higher resolution and longer videos with a ChatGPT Pro subscription.\\nOpenAI executives say Sora will lead to new possibilities for artists and creatives.\\n“We really believe that Sora can open doors for people to explore and share their creativity visually, especially without extensive resources or training,” said Souki Mansoor, Sora artist program lead for OpenAI, in an interview. “As we know, filmmaking is very expensive.”\\nHollywood Inc.\\nWashed Out’s new music video was created with AI. Is it a watershed moment for Sora?\\nWashed Out is the first major music artist to commission a music video using OpenAI’s Sora text-to-video technology.\\nMay 2, 2024\\nThe tool will be accessible for people 18 or older where ChatGPT is available, except for in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and countries in the European Economic Area. OpenAI said it is working on enabling Sora in those locations. The company is also preparing a free version of Sora.\\nAdvertisement\\nAI is a major source of tension in the entertainment industry. It was a key issue in last year’s strikes by actors and writers, who sought protections from the rising tech as part of their contract negotiations.\\nMany have also raised concerns about how AI models are trained and whether intellectual property rights holders and artists are being compensated fairly, or at all, for content digested by the powerful technology.\\nEntertainment companies meanwhile have been exploring partnerships with AI startups as a way to save money.\\nAdvertisement\\nMansoor said that OpenAI is sensitive to the concerns raised by creatives about potential job losses, but is optimistic about the opportunities.\\n“Sora is designed as a creative collaborator, so the hope is that it helps artists bring very ambitious projects to life without expensive resources,” Mansoor said. “We think that this is raising the bar for what’s possible in video creation.”\\nHollywood Inc.\\nWe went to a gala for AI-produced movies. Here’s what we saw\\nA behind the scenes look at a film gala held in San Francisco that screened movies made with artificial intelligence.\\nSept. 26, 2024\\nSora’s proponents say it could help artists test bold ideas without as many budget constraints. Alexia Adana, a New York-based creative director and visual artist, made the case that it could enable more stories from people, including underrepresented creators, who lack financial resources or equipment.\\n“We’re in this age where you can create anything and you can learn anything, and it’s either free or very low cost,” said Adana, who had early access to Sora. “This is such an exciting time for people who wouldn’t normally have the resources to demonstrate their vision.”\\nAdana used Sora to create a film concept called “Bloomchild,” which depicted a child made of soil and dirt who blooms and struggles to fit in. She said it was influenced by her own experiences as a person from Jamaica who grew up in the suburbs of Connecticut.\\n“I’m able to use a tool to come up with a full-on trailer,” Adana said. “I would have never been able to do that before.”\\nAdvertisement\\nIndie pop artist Washed Out used Sora to create a music video. The director said the tool allowed him to show scenes from multiple places at a fraction of the cost of shooting on location. Meanwhile, a video that explained the origins of Toys R Us was made 80% with Sora, said Nik Kleverov, chief creative officer of Native Foreign, a Culver City-based creative agency and production company.\\nHollywood Inc.\\nAI is supposed to be Hollywood’s next big thing. What’s taking so long?\\nAs AI technology advances, industry observers expect to see more deals between tech companies and studios and talent. But major challenges remain.\\nOct. 17, 2024\\nOpenAI said Sora will have safety measures in place to prevent abuses of the tool, such as child nudity.\\nRohan Sahai, Sora’s engineering lead, said OpenAI has done “a lot of safety work to better understand how we prevent misuse” since Sora was first announced in February.\\nSome artists are angry with how OpenAI has gone about testing and developing Sora. Last month, a group of artists posted concerns in an online letter about how many creators, in their view, are being used to test and promote the technology without adequate compensation.\\nThe open letter has received more than 1,170 signatures, including from London artist Jake Elwes.\\n“While hundreds contribute for free, a select few will be chosen through a competition to have their Sora-created films screened — offering minimal compensation which pales in comparison to the substantial PR and marketing value OpenAI receives,” the artists wrote.\\nAdvertisement\\nMansoor said that the group’s comments had no influence on the timing of Sora’s launch. She said that the company focused on giving early access to artists who would be most disrupted by tools like Sora and give them the option of helping shape the tool’s development.\\n“There was no obligation to even use the tool, much less give feedback,” she said.\\nMansoor said she came from the creative industry, spending more than a decade in independent filmmaking. “I came to OpenAI to create the kinds of experiences that I wish I had coming up in the industry,” she said.\\nKleverov said the concerns raised by the letter didn’t reflect the views of early testers. “The AI world is already so small and then within the world, those of us who are playing with Sora — it’s such a supportive space,” he said.\\nWalter Woodman, a director and co-founder of Toronto and L.A. production company Shy Kids, said once people experience Sora, “then everyone will see that it is not a magic bullet.” Shy Kids has used Sora to work on short films including “My Love.”\\nMany creators who have used AI tools say it takes time to get the hang of the tools and that the technology has important limitations.\\n“Sora can help, much like a camera, editing equipment, or great performance,” Woodman said in an email. “But without great storytelling and storytellers, it will be just a tool on the shelf. However, those with talent are in for a creative awakening.”\\nMore to Read\\nColumn: OpenAI just scored a huge victory in a copyright case ... or did it?\\nNov. 13, 2024\\nAI startup funding hit a record in the L.A. area last quarter.

This innovative tool allows users to create videos simply by typing text prompts, marking a significant advancement in AI technology. Available on Sora.com, Sora offers numerous features and capabilities for creating realistic videos, and its public release has ignited excitement across creative industries.\\nInitially revealed to select users back and tested this past February, OpenAI gradually rolled out access to Sora, quickly gathering feedback from early adopters. Following months of anticipation, the company announced its public availability on Monday, along with the introduction of the \"Sora Turbo\" model, promising significantly faster processing times than its predecessor. This upgrade certainly caught the attention of the tech-savvy audience eager to witness the future of video content creation.\\nOpenAI\\'s Sora operates under the same generative AI principles as text-to-image models. At its core, Sora leverages advanced algorithms to translate written instructions directly to video content, turning words on the screen to visual storytelling. Users can generate videos lasting up to 20 seconds and at resolutions of 720p to 1080p, depending on their subscription level.\\nThe service is available primarily for subscribers of ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) and ChatGPT Pro ($200/month). While the Plus version allows users to generate shorter videos with lower resolution, the Pro plan features expanded capabilities, such as longer videos, enhanced resolution, and even the option to download videos without watermarks. OpenAI is also offering the ability to upload personal assets to customize and remix generated videos.\\nDuring the livestreamed event on launch day, OpenAI\\'s CEO, Sam Altman, showcased Sora’s various functionalities, including the \"Explore\" page, which allows users to browse community-shared videos. The interface is user-friendly and mimics storyboarding, providing creators with the ability to organize and control their video content more efficiently.\\nDespite the innovative features, OpenAI has been transparent about the limitations of the Sora model. According to the company, Sora sometimes struggles with realism—especially when it involves complex actions or simulating physics accurately. The technology is still developing, and as it stands, videos generated may not always meet professional-grade standards.\\nSecurity and ethical usage were also major themes during OpenAI\\'s presentations. The company has taken precautions to address potential misuse, implementing safeguards such as the C2PA metadata embedded within videos, which helps viewers verify their origins. Sora is programmed to block content associated with illegal activities and harmful representations, such as child abuse and deepfake pornography. These preventive measures highlight the responsibility OpenAI recognizes as leaders within the AI industry.\\nIndustry leaders are already taking note of Sora’s potential. Content creators like Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) have described their initial experiences with the tool as both \"horrifying and inspiring.\" His insights suggest users are beginning to explore creative boundaries, albeit with caution about the consequences of such powerful AI tools becoming widely accessible.\\nCreative professionals are considering Sora\\'s capacities for practical applications. For example, Tyler Perry emphasized the way tools like Sora could potentially alter the future of production, noting AI\\'s ability to minimize the need for large sets and on-location shooting. Already, some creators are brainstorming how to utilize Sora for everything from marketing campaigns to entirely new storytelling modes.\\nWith Sora now available, discussions around the ethical frameworks governing its usage are gaining traction. OpenAI is open to community feedback, hoping users will contribute insights and recommendations to help refine the model\\'s safety and usability protocols. During the launch, Rohan Sahai, Sora’s product lead, indicated the team’s commitment to ensuring the technology is not only innovative but also socially responsible.\\nFor those eager to try their hand at AI video creation, Sora is the perfect tool to explore new creative avenues. Although it might not replace traditional filmmaking just yet, its potential for enhancing creativity and efficiency could reshape how videos are produced and experienced. OpenAI\\'s foray with Sora stands as yet another chapter in the ever-evolving story of AI technology, showcasing the possibilities as it strides forward.\\nAvailable on numerous platforms, Sora offers exciting directions for video content creation. Users are encouraged to experiment and see how they can leverage the AI’s capabilities to push boundaries. Given the rapid pace of innovation, it’s anyone\\'s guess what the future holds as more creators embrace these tools to tell their stories and share their messages creatively.\\nOpenAI\\'s Sora is more than just another tech development; it\\'s fostering conversations about creativity, ethics, and future possibilities, reminding us of AI’s powerful place at the intersection of technology and art.\\nLoved What You Read?

       "   'raw_content': 'Advertisement\\nWhile hype envelops OpenAI’s genAI video platform Sora, some warn against commercial use\\nDecember 11, 2024 | 12 min read\\nListen to article\\n4 min\\nSome say Sora will supercharge marketing and commercial creativity. Others are less convinced.\\nWhile some marketers are bullish on Sora\\'s commercial potential, others are saying, \"Not so fast.\" / Adobe Stock\\nAs part of its ‘ship-mas’ product push ahead of the holidays, ChatGPT parent OpenAI on Monday released Sora, its highly anticipated video-generation platform, which was previously available only to a select group of testers.\\nIt’s a launch that some experts believe could greatly disrupt commercial creativity.\\nAfter iterating for a number of months, OpenAI has developed an enhanced version of the tool, dubbed Sora Turbo, available now via Sora.com for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users in the US and some other markets. Sora Turbo promises faster video creation capabilities, enabling users to produce realistic, 1080p resolution videos that are up to 20 seconds long from text prompts. The model supports a variety of aspect ratios and allows users to customize content with their own assets or create entirely new visuals.\\nThe product also includes a ‘storyboard tool’ that gives users the ability to more precisely tailor each frame in a video. Plus, community-driven feeds are rolling out within the platform to showcase user-generated content.\\n“We hope this early version of Sora will enable people everywhere to explore new forms of creativity, tell their stories, and push the boundaries of what’s possible with video storytelling,” the company said in a blog post announcing the release.\\nThe company said that Sora Turbo is “much faster” than the preview of Sora released to limited users in February, and noted that the team is working to make the tool more affordable in the future.\\nThe company also addressed growing concerns about transparency and disclosures around AI-generated content. It explained that Sora-made videos include C2PA metadata as well as visible, by-default watermarks. Plus, the company has built an internal search function that uses technical parameters to identify a video’s provenance. All of these features can, in theory, be used to determine whether a video was developed via Sora, helping to tamp down on the spread of misinformation online and potentially mitigate intellectual property disputes.\\nOpenAI has also implemented content guardrails on Sora – blocked content includes child sexual abuse materials and sexual deepfakes.\\nSora is not yet available in the UK or most of Europe.\\nThe believers make their case\\nExperts in marketing, production and communications are somewhat divided on the degree to which Sora might unseat traditional creative development.\\nAt minimum, the tool’s capabilities appear to have evolved beyond what was showcased in a highly ridiculed Toys R Us ad in June.\\nAnd some are extremely bullish on its potential.\\n“Sora is transforming how we approach commercial creativity and marketing,” says Nikola Baldikov, founder and CEO at Inbound Blogging, an SEO-focused content firm. “It’s making high-quality content creation more accessible than ever. It cuts out the need for expensive pre-production processes and professional equipment, which opens doors for smaller brands and creators who didn’t have the resources before.”\\nThe sentiment is echoed by Dev Nag, CEO of support automation firm QueryPal, who says, “Just as stock photography transformed print advertising decades ago, Sora and similar AI video tools will make high-quality video content creation more accessible and dramatically faster – and because creators can generate exactly what they envision rather than searching through existing assets, the creative possibilities expand exponentially.”\\nAdvertisement\\nNag expects that ongoing improvements to Sora’s capabilities will have long-term implications for the economics and operations of advertising and marketing. For now, he says, we’re entering a “first wave,” where we’ll see streamlined day-to-day production of assets like social media ads and product demos.\\nBut in his perspective, the rapid clip at which AI capabilities are advancing “suggests that any current technical limitations will largely disappear within 18 to 24 months” – meaning that, before long, we’ll hit a “second wave.” This era, he predicts, will see expanded use cases for video-generation technologies like Sora. “Creatives and agencies [will] start leveraging this technology as a creative partner, rapidly prototyping ideas and exploring creative directions at unprecedented speed and scale,” he says.\\nBut Sora’s capabilities may not just reshape how creative teams work – but could also reshape creative teams themselves. Baldikov expects that streamlined ideation and drafting could free teams up to focus more on high-level storytelling and strategy – but it could also replace jobs. “If tasks like concept visualization and quick content drafts can now be done in minutes, you simply don\\'t need to have a large team to perform them,” he says.\\nThe skeptic’s view\\nThough Sora’s arrival comes with much fanfare, competing in an increasingly crowded generative AI landscape won’t necessarily be a cakewalk.\\nA handful of other text-to-video models have already established themselves as formidable competitors. Chief among them is Runway. Known for its seamless integration with creative workflows, high-quality outputs and emphasis on artistic freedom, Runway has also positioned itself as a tool for creative professionals like filmmakers and designers.\\nAnd some experts believe OpenAI has, in some ways, already missed a critical window of opportunity to inspire Sora adoption among entertainment, production and advertising shops.\\n“The ‘prosumer’ and ‘pro’ user segments include film studios, advertising agencies, VFX and animation studios – all of these are already being served well by companies like Runway, which has large customers across all these segments,” says Sanja Partalo, co-founder and general partner at S4S Ventures, which invests in companies at the intersection or marketing, advertising and media. She also flags Autodesk-owned Wonder Dynamics as a leader in generative animation.\\nAdvertisement\\nBut beyond the competitive market of text-to-video generation, Sora may still suffer technical limitations. Beta users noted earlier this year that, despite the sophisticated imagery, the model ran into visual missteps common in AI-generated imagery and videos – sometimes failing to depict hands with the correct number of fingers, for example.\\nThough OpenAI has been working for months to smooth out technical issues like these, the company acknowledged in its blog post yesterday that the product remains imperfect. “The version of Sora we are deploying has many limitations,” OpenAI wrote. “It often generates unrealistic physics and struggles with complex actions over long durations.”\\nSome marketers remain unconvinced by any technical advancements that Sora may have made in the months since it was released in beta. “Sora is great for bogus, bastardized, nonsensical, dreamlike sequences,” says Bernard Meyer, senior director of creative and communications at Omnisend, an e-commerce and email marketing firm.\\nSpeaking more generally, Meyer suggests that AI-generated video tends to fall short when it comes to “creating visual consistency,” and says that humans can frequently pinpoint these visual inconsistencies. “When even the smallest detail is ‘off,’ we can spot it and it will distract us from the focus or purpose of the video,” he says.\\nTechnical limitations aside, Sora-made videos may fall flat for want of greater cultural context and human emotion, says Daria Shevchenko, CMO at Snov.io, which helps firms automate their marketing efforts. In her view, no amount of technical innovation will translate seamlessly into “content that will resonate with real people.” She says, “Only people know how to do that.”\\nWeighing the legal and ethical landmines\\nSora’s rollout has also sparked concerns over legal and ethical issues that could complicate its widespread adoption. Key concerns include its potential impact on copyright, asset protection and regulatory compliance, particularly as it becomes more integrated into commercial and creative industries.\\nCatch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.\\nStay up to date with a curated digest of the most important marketing stories and expert insights from our global team.\\nLearn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum.\\nWhile Sora may represent a breakthrough in AI-generated content, it shines a spotlight on consumers’ and lawmakers’ growing concerns about authenticity, provenance and intellectual property rights, says Alon Yamin, the co-founder and CEO of Copyleaks, an AI-based text analysis platform. He advocates for “proper regulations, tools and… best practices that safeguard authenticity and ensure ethical use.”\\nOpenAI has not disclosed the specific datasets used to train Sora, but like many other consumer-facing generative AI models, it’s probable that the program was trained on a vast range of publicly available information, which may include work in the public domain, copyrighted materials and other sources. The possibility that the model was trained on copyrighted work creates potential legal pitfalls for users and for OpenAI.\\nBrian Sanford, the creative editor and director of post-production at Versus, a production studio, partook in the artist beta, and has had extended access to Sora for the past six months. While he’s been somewhat impressed by the ability to generate longer videos and the visual fidelity of the end product, he remains skeptical about the system’s training. And ultimately, Sanford sees this as a prohibitive hurdle. “Without a clear understanding” of how Sora was trained, he says, “it will be difficult to deploy the system in commercial production.”\\nThe notion is echoed by Terri Walter, managing director of B2B marketing platform SalientMG, who says that Sora is still “far from being a tool we would recommend for commercial use cases.”\\nShe argues that Sora falls short in terms of asset protection and proper governance, making it a potential liability for marketers and advertisers. She urges the industry to keep an eye on OpenAI’s governance practices and remain vigilant in complying with data privacy regulations like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and the UK’s Online Safety Act.\\nWalter also suggests that advertisers and marketers get involved in novel standards-setting efforts like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (CP2A) – founded in 2021 by a cohort including Adobe, BBC, Intel and Microsoft – which aims to establish an open-access technical standard for verifying a piece of content’s origins and authenticity. Deployed in combination with developer-led efforts – like digital watermarks – such standards can help establish critical ethical protections for AI-generated content.\\nSora-generated videos come with CP2A metadata by default – meaning that their provenance should always be identifiable on the web.\\nToday, the need for effective authenticity and provenance verification is growing, evidenced by an explosion of AI-generated misinformation this year – from realistic faux images of young hurricane survivors to a Soviet-era-inspired image portraying Kamala Harris as a communist.\\nExperts remain divided on the extent to which Sora will revolutionize marketing and commercial creativity, but one thing is clear: the influx of AI-generated video in the industry and in the world comes with a plethora of legal and ethical quandaries yet to be fully addressed.\\nShortly after its public launch on Monday, OpenAI barred new Sora signups due to high demand.\\nFor more, sign up for The Drum’s daily newsletter here.\\nMore from Artificial Intelligence\\nMarketing can change the world.\\n© Carnyx Group Ltd 2024 | The Drum is a Registered Trademark and property of Carnyx Group Limited.

AI videos are set to transform how people engage with content by making it more interactive. Consumers who once passively consumed media can now easily create their own. No longer confined to text, sound, or static images, AI now generates short videos and is being explored for longer films, though challenges with accuracy and consistency remain.\\nCompanies such as Runway AI, Luma AI, Pika Labs, Meta, Hailuo AI, and among others, are at the forefront, racing to enhance their tools. Runway’s Act-One and Camera Control offer professional tools to add nuances to videos. Luma AI and Hailuo AI excel at animating figures from user-uploaded images, seamlessly transforming static visuals into dynamic scenes aligned with textual prompts. This empowers everyday users to experiment with creative ideas, stepping into the role of a producer or director effortlessly.\\nPotential of AI Videos Across Industry\\nAI video generators are reshaping industries like advertising, e-commerce, education, and entertainment by making content creation more dynamic, personalized, and accessible. In advertising, brands can produce localized and interactive campaigns tailored to diverse audiences without costly production teams. This trend is visible in the growth of AI video advertisement startups.\\nIn e-commerce, AI-generated videos can create immersive shopping experiences, turning static images into dynamic product showcases or crafting personalized promotion videos that boost engagement. In education, AI has the potential to bring complex concepts to life through explainer videos, virtual tours, or localized instructional content, expanding global access to learning.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### iOS 18.2—Update Now Warning Issued To All iPhone Users\\n### Microsoft Warns 400 Million Windows Users—Do Not Update Your PC\\n### Selena Gomez And Benny Blanco Are Engaged—And The Internet Has Opinions\\nIn entertainment, filmmakers and musicians are experimenting with AI to produce fantastical visuals and animations, democratizing tools that were once limited to big-budget studios. For instance, the 2024 Tribeca Festival and OpenAI collaborated to debut five original short films. Runway AI held AI film festivals, and initiated the Hundred Film Fund, which will provide grants ranging from $5,000 up to $1 million to selected filmmakers using its technology.\\nAcross these fields, AI video technology is lowering barriers, enabling creativity, and transforming how businesses and individuals engage with media. While AI video tools increase efficiency and allow small budget productions, they also raise an important question: How can we preserve human touch and meaningful stories?\\nStrengths and Challenges of AI Video Generators\\nAI video generators are particularly strong at creating surreal and fantastical visuals, similar to the revolutionary art movements of Dadaism and Surrealism. They allow creators to produce scenes that would be impossible in real life, opening new avenues for storytelling.\\nFor instance, the Toronto-based pop band Shy Kids created a short film titled “Air Head,” featuring a quirky character with a balloon face navigating various scenarios—working, driving, exploring city streets, celebrating at a party, traveling to Rome in one scene, and soaring over the Arctic Ocean in another.\\nIn OpenAI’s Sora showcase, a Singaporean artist depicted elderly women emerging from eggs, riding a giant cat, and painting a massive foot. These whimsical scenes offered a humorous yet poignant commentary on aging. Another artist used Sora to show a singer perched on Ionic Greek columns transforming into a bird, blending styles and eras seamlessly. AI thrives at juxtaposing disparate elements, enabling creators to visualize imaginative narratives that are difficult to shoot with a camera in real world.\\nHowever, AI’s ability to fabricate fantastical scenes comes with risks. These tools blur the line between reality and fiction, which can confuse audiences, especially younger viewers. Clear labeling is essential to help users distinguish AI-generated visuals from real-life content.\\nAI video generators also face limitations. They lack the depth to authentically portray human life, as their creations are based on algorithms rather than lived experiences. AI videos might exacerbate the problems of deepfakes and misinformation, as AI can create realistic yet deceptive visuals. Overreliance on AI may discourage the effort and thought needed for meaningful storytelling.\\nIn addition, the machine learning models behind AI video apps often struggle with technical limitations, leading to awkwardly morphing characters, distorted objects, abrupt lighting changes, and unnatural interactions between characters. Coca-Cola’s recent AI-generated holiday ad, criticized as “soulless,” reveals the absence of human touch in many AI creations.\\nTo leverage AI’s strengths, creators should focus on fantastical storytelling and blending unique styles. At the same time, they must address these challenges by merging human elements into AI videos.\\nPreserving Human Creativity in an AI Era\\nHistorically, humans have continuously developed new mediums and forms of media to connect with and interpret the world.\\nIn Shakespeare’s time, public theater brought people together to witness the power struggles among aristocrats, the tragedy of impulsive romances, and the twists of human folly—performed live before their eyes. Cinema shifted these performances to the screen, where audiences gathered to experience stories through the lens of cameras and projection systems, replacing the immediacy of live actors with the magic of film.\\nHistory of British theatre: early playhouse from 1570 - 1629 .

(Photo by Culture Club/Getty Images) *** Local Caption ***\\nGetty Images\\nTelevision brought entertainment into individual homes, changing how we spent time with family and friends. It encouraged hours of passive viewing, turning the couch into a central hub of leisure. The internet further revolutionized engagement by connecting people not through letters, phone calls, or face-to-face interactions, but through fiber-optic cables that transmitted electronic signals and vast streams of information instantly across the globe.\\nPlatforms like YouTube, Netflix, and other video-streaming services introduced a new era of media consumption, shifting preferences from reading stories and reflecting on their meaning to indulging in visual spectacles. These tantalizing displays appealed to our senses, offering quick and captivating content that increasingly prioritized immediacy and entertainment over depth and contemplation.\\nAI video generators build on this evolution, making content creation interactive and more efficient than ever. However, they risk stripping media of its sensitivity to human emotions and experience. German philosopher Walter Benjamin famously argued that art’s “aura” stems from the “here and now” that embodied the physical and intellectual engagement of the artist at the moment of creation. While AI-generated content boasts efficiency, it often lacks the deliberate labor and human touch that give traditional art its depth and meaning.\\nEase of use removes the challenges that drive creativity. Just as hand crafted furniture and haute couture retain their appeal in a world of mass production, human-created art will always hold a unique place in culture. AI tools should complement creativity, not replace it.\\nAs we engage with AI videos, thoughtful adoption is key. By using AI as a collaborator, not a substitute, we can amplify our imagination and push the boundaries of storytelling.\\nFollow me on\\xa0LinkedIn.\\nGerui Wang\\nFollowing\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\nOne Community.

Here’s how it works.\\n(Image credit: Ubisoft)\\nLook, forgive me, all right? It\\'s Friday afternoon as I write this, and I know I\\'ve picked a silly image to go with an article on what is quite an important topic. But Meta has called its new AI-generated video watermarking tool the Video Seal, and sometimes the header image picks itself.\\nLet\\'s get down to brass tacks. Or beach balls, one of the two. (Stop it now - Ed). Deepfakes are a serious concern, with a recent Ofcom survey reporting that two in five participants said they\\'d seen at least one AI-generated deepfake in the last six months.\\nDeepfake content has the potential to harm and spread disinformation, so Meta releasing a tool to watermark AI-generated videos is probably a net benefit for the world (via TechCrunch). Meta Video Seal is open source, and designed to be integrated into existing software to apply imperceptible watermarks to AI-generated video clips.\\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Pierre Fernandez, an AI research scientist at Meta, said: \"We developed Video Seal to provide a more effective video watermarking solution, particularly for detecting AI-generated videos and protecting originality.\\n\"While other watermarking tools exist, they don’t offer sufficient robustness to video compression, which is very prevalent when sharing content through social platforms; weren’t efficient enough to run at scale; weren’t open or reproducible; or were derived from image watermarking, which is suboptimal for videos.\"\\nMeta has already released a non-video specific watermarking tool, Watermark Anything, and a tool specifically for audio, called, you guessed it, Audio Seal. This latest, video-focussed effort is designed to be much more resilient than similar software from DeepMind and Microsoft, although Fernandez admits that heavy compression and significant edits may alter the watermarks or \"render them unrecoverable.\"\\nStill, anything more resistant to removal than the current options strikes as a good thing, as a quick Google reveals multiple methods of AI-generated content watermark removal, which I won\\'t link to here. Still, the info is out there, and that means potentially harmful content is currently going unchecked.\\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\\nBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\\nWith a watermark in place, news outlets and fact checkers the world over can correctly determine whether a video is potentially real, or created by AI. The real uphill battle now is widespread adoption, as no matter how effective the tool is at flagging AI videos, it\\'ll matter not a jot if no-one uses it.\\nTo that end, Meta also has plans to launch a public leaderboard, called the Meta Omni Seal Bench, which will compare the performance of watermarking methods, and is currently organising workshops at next years ICLR AI conference. Fernandez says the team hopes more AI researchers and developers will integrate watermarking into their work, and that they want to collaborate with the industry and academic community to \"progress faster in the field.\"\\nSo come for the seals, stay for the fight against AI-generated misinformation. Sometimes it can feel like we\\'re drowning under a wave of an AI industry moving incredibly quickly into the future—with minimal checks and balances—so it\\'s difficult not to applaud Meta for making attempts to rein in some of the more egregious side effects.\\nParticularly if it makes me think of this fella.

The commoditization of generative AI has led to an absolute explosion of fake content online: According to ID verification platform Sumsub, there’s been a 4x increase in deepfakes worldwide from 2023 to 2024. In 2024, deepfakes accounted for 7% of all fraud, per Sumsub, ranging from impersonations and account takeovers to sophisticated social engineering campaigns.\\nIn what it hopes will be a meaningful contribution to the fight against deepfakes, Meta is releasing a tool to apply imperceptible watermarks to AI-generated video clips. Announced on Thursday, the tool, called Meta Video Seal, is available in open source and designed to be integrated into existing software. The tool joins Meta’s other watermarking tools, Watermark Anything (re-released today under a permissive license) and Audio Seal.\\n“We developed Video Seal to provide a more effective video watermarking solution, particularly for detecting AI-generated videos and protecting originality,” Pierre Fernandez, AI research scientist at Meta, told TechCrunch in an interview.\\nVideo Seal isn’t the first technology of its kind. DeepMind’s SynthID can watermark videos, and Microsoft has its own video watermarking methodologies.\\nBut Fernandez asserts that many existing approaches fall short.\\n“While other watermarking tools exist, they don’t offer sufficient robustness to video compression, which is very prevalent when sharing content through social platforms; weren’t efficient enough to run at scale; weren’t open or reproducible; or were derived from image watermarking, which is suboptimal for videos,” Fernandez said.\\nIn addition to a watermark, Video Seal can add a hidden message to videos that can later be uncovered to determine their origins. Meta claims that Video Seal is resilient against common edits like blurring and cropping, as well as popular compression algorithms.\\nFernandez admits that Video Seal has certain limitations, mainly the trade-off between how perceptible the tool’s watermarks are and their overall resilience to manipulation. Heavy compression and significant edits may alter the watermarks or render them unrecoverable, he added.\\nOf course, the bigger problem facing Video Seal is that devs and industry won’t have much reason to adopt it, particularly those already using proprietary solutions. In a bid to address that, Meta is launching a public leaderboard, Meta Omni Seal Bench, dedicated to comparing the performance of various watermarking methods, and organizing a workshop on watermarking this year at ICLR, a major AI conference.\\n“We hope that more and more AI researchers and developers will integrate some form of watermarking into their work,” Fernandez said. “We want to collaborate with the industry and the academic community to progress faster in the field.”\\nTopics\\nAI, AI, deepfakes, Generative AI, Media & Entertainment, Meta, meta video seal, open source, watermarking\\nMost Popular\\nChatGPT and Sora experienced a major outage\\nMaxwell Zeff\\nMicrosoft will take an $800M hit over Cruise robotaxi shutdown\\nKirsten Korosec\\nIt sure looks like OpenAI trained Sora on game content — and legal experts say that could be a problem\\nKyle Wiggers\\nCruise employees ‘blindsided’ by GM’s plan to end robotaxi program\\nKirsten Korosec\\nRebecca Bellan\\nGoogle unveils Project Mariner: AI agents to use the web for you\\nMaxwell Zeff\\nResearchers uncover Chinese spyware used to target Android devices\\nCarly Page\\nGoogle says its new quantum chip indicates that multiple universes exist\\nJulie Bort\\nKyle Wiggers\\nSenior Reporter, Enterprise\\n@Kyle_L_Wiggers\\nKyle Wiggers is a senior reporter at TechCrunch with a special interest in artificial intelligence.

The tools can be anything that helps people perform at their top form, from a favorite drafting table to the best software program to a lucky pen, a vintage typewriter or a pair of headphones.\\nNext up is\\xa0Graham Nhlamba, senior designer/art director at Thinkingbox in Toronto.\\nWhat is one tool you use all the time at work, and how does it inspire your work?\\nThere is one web tool that I can’t seem to get enough of these days – the EyeCandy motion library—a visual technique library for visual technique lovers. It’s incredible. I get lost in it and discover so many new ways to tell stories, evoke emotion, and build intrigue—all through a six-second looping Gif with no audio.\\nWhy is it your favorite?\\nA lot of what I do as a designer and art director is consume media to keep me inspired and in-the-know when it comes to visual trends. EyeCandy makes that media bite-size.\\nI find myself looking at a six-second clip of an A$AP Rocky music video over and over again wondering: How did they get the camera to move that way? Can I get the typography in my work to emulate that motion? If this were static, how would I get that feeling to come across?\\nI do this daily, focusing on a different technique each time, just to understand how it works.\\nThe reason I like this tool so much is because cinematography and video editing techniques are outside the realm of what I do on a day-to-day basis. I admire how innovative film professionals get with the use of their tools and I sometimes envy the practical aspects of what working with a camera and a dolly can do. When I get a chance to recreate any of the techniques I see in the library in my own way, it makes my day.\\nThe great thing about this being a web tool is I can use it anywhere (as long as I have a device and a stable internet connection).\\nHow did you acquire your tool or hear about it for the first time?\\nI heard about this library from a film-obsessed colleague who thought I’d have fun with it.\\nHow does it help you be successful?\\nThe most helpful aspect of using this tool has been building up my technique vocabulary. Knowing certain terminology when speaking on your vision (especially when art directing) makes collaborating with other creatives a lot easier. In my early days in the creative industry, I used to speak in sound effects and hand gestures (whoosh! zoom! skreee!). Safe to say I feel a lot more “professional” in meetings now—although the sound effects do make a guest appearance on occasion.\\nDoes it have sentimental value?\\nNot yet. I think that will depend on who I share it with in the future—and whether it’ll change their life in some way. That hasn’t happened yet, so I’m not as precious about it.\\nDo you think your tool could go TikTok viral? Why or why not?\\nI think it definitely could. It could make a strong addition to the curriculum for TikTok University, a free, certified course from the platform that teaches aspiring creators how to improve their skills. Plus, even creators talking about it could help drum up some visibility; a lot of folks go on TikTok to learn how to do things, so I think EyeCandy would fit right in. Perhaps they could collaborate with some of the cinematographers and editors who use these techniques.\\nWe want to know what tools you use to make you successful.

One of the more under-the-radar\\xa0LCNC threats is OData injection, an attack vector that can expose sensitive corporate data and is predominant on the Microsoft\\xa0Power Platform. This new vulnerability is poorly understood by security professionals in LCNC environments, where traditional safeguards are lacking.\\nWhat Is OData?\\nOData, or Open Data Protocol, is an\\xa0OASIS standard\\xa0that has gained traction in LCNC platforms as a way to manage and deliver data through REST APIs. It\\'s widely adopted because it allows seamless communication between applications and data sources, regardless of the underlying data storage model. In LCNC environments, it is commonly used as a query language to retrieve data from a variety of sources, such as SQL databases, SharePoint, or Dataverse.\\nOData is particularly valuable in LCNC platforms because of its simplicity — developers don\\'t need to be database experts to use it, and the same query language can be used for very different data sources.\\nThe OData Injection Threat\\nOData injection manipulates user input that is later used by an application or automation to form an OData query. The query is then applied to an enterprise data source. This allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to manipulate or exfiltrate sensitive user and corporate data.\\nWhile\\xa0SQL injection (SQLi)\\xa0is generally understood by security professionals, OData injection poses a different set of challenges, especially in LCNC environments, where multiple data sources are often connected and managed by citizen developers with minimal security training. Unlike SQLi, which is confined to relational databases, OData can connect to a wide array of data sources, including custom applications and third-party services, broadening the potential impact of an attack.\\nOData also lacks the well-established security practices that have been developed for SQL. For example, SQLi can typically be mitigated with parameterized queries, a practice that has become standard over the years. OData injection, however, doesn\\'t have a similar one-size-fits-all solution. Developers must create custom input validation mechanisms — a manual and error-prone process. In addition, the general lack of awareness of OData injection techniques further reduces the likelihood that custom validation methods will be implemented.\\nA New External Attack Surface\\nOData vulnerabilities in LCNC environments often stem from the unrecognized risks associated with external data inputs. These are frequently integrated into workflows that manipulate critical enterprise data, including Web forms, email messages, social media, and external Web applications. These inputs typically are accepted without stringent validation, leaving the attack surface vulnerable and often undefended, as developers and security teams may overlook these sources as potential risks.\\nThis oversight allows attackers to exploit these inputs by injecting malicious OData queries. For instance, a simple product feedback form could be exploited to extract sensitive data or modify stored information.\\nSecurity Challenges\\nBecause most citizen developers don\\'t have formal\\xa0security training\\xa0and are often unfamiliar with the dangers of accepting unchecked external inputs in their workflows, OData Injection vulnerabilities can flourish undetected.\\nAlso, unlike SQL injection, validating user inputs in OData queries requires a more hands-on approach. Developers must manually sanitize inputs — removing harmful characters, ensuring proper formatting, and guarding against common injection techniques. This process takes time, effort, and more advanced programming knowledge\\xa0that most LCNC developers lack.\\nFurthermore, in traditional development environments, security vulnerabilities are often tracked and remediated through ticketing systems or backlog management tools like Jira. This formal process does not exist in most LCNC development environments, where developers may not be full-time coders and have no formalized way to handle bug tracking or vulnerability management.\\nMitigation Best Practices\\nCombating OData injection requires a proactive security strategy. Ideally, LCNC developers should be trained on OData query risks and how external inputs could be exploited. This is unrealistic, since citizen developers aren\\'t full-time coders.\\nInstead, automation can play a significant role in monitoring and detecting OData injection vulnerabilities. Security teams should deploy tools that continuously assess LCNC environments for potential vulnerabilities, especially as new applications and workflows are created. This will help identify weaknesses early and quickly provide developers with actionable insights into how to fix them.\\nCollaboration between security teams and LCNC developers is another essential piece of the puzzle. Security teams should be granted access to monitor the development process in real-time, particularly in environments where critical corporate data is being processed. When vulnerabilities are identified, security must communicate clearly with developers, offering specific guidance on how to remediate issues. This could include best practices for input validation and sanitation, as well as tools for automating the process where possible.\\nLastly, security should be integrated into the LCNC development life cycle. Much like the \"shift-left\" movement in traditional software development, security checks should be built into the LCNC workflow from the outset. Automated testing tools can be leveraged to scan for vulnerabilities as applications are being built, reducing the likelihood of OData injection vulnerabilities slipping through the cracks.\\nAs the adoption of LCNC continues to grow, so will the complexity of the threats organizations face. Addressing LCNC vulnerabilities like OData injection now will help keep enterprises safe in the long run.\\nAbout the Author\\nAmichai Shulman\\nCTO & Co-Founder, Nokod Security\\nAmichai Shulman, chief technology officer (CTO) and co-founder of Nokod Security, is an internationally recognized expert and researcher in data and application security.

Moreover, the show, which is widely regarded as one of the best video game adaptations ever, also has the added benefit of centering its epic narrative around a queer couple, Vi and Caitlyn Kiramman.\\nTo gain insights into the intimacy, love, and conflict in Arcane‘s final season (and get juicy details about the CaitVi ship straight from the source), we spoke with lead writer Amanda Overton and asked her how she, Riot Games, and Fortiche worked together to bring the show’s most resonant moments to life.\\nThe interview has been edited for brevity.\\nIsaiah Colbert, io9: Video game adaptations often walk the line for fans with how well they follow their source material and whether or not they go to the beat of their own drum. What was your guiding principle for writing Arcane’s second and final season?\\nAmanda Overton: The guiding principle was always to make the best TV show possible. We were really fortunate that Riot was behind us in saying, “We know this is a TV show, not a game. You do you when it comes to making the best TV show you can.”\\nChristian [Linke] and Alex [Yee] had been at Riot Games since there were only 40 people at that company. Alex actually helped create a lot of the champions that everybody loved. And they really loved the game, really loved the fans. We always wanted to be inspired by the game, and there was an element of how much of the game and the lore we could draw from so that fans would recognize things that they loved in the show as well.\\nOne of the funniest examples for me is creating the Z-Drive for Ekko in episode seven. He had this lore of having crafted the Z-Drive, the magic from these different shards of magic crystals, and we were like, “Oh, we have shards of magic crystals that might be left in the wall of that exciting event in our series.” We thought it would be fun if it was something that ended up in that alternate reality killing Vi, one of our favorite characters, then it would take Powder overcoming her emotional trauma in order to help him with that. It was a way to be inspired by the lore and add that emotional dimension we had crafted in the television series.\\n© Netflix / Fortiche\\nio9: Arguably, one of Arcane’s most gratifying moments was the canonization of Caitlyn and Vi. In a medium that’s often been accused of queerbating, fetishizing, burying its gays, or outright censoring them, as was the case with The Legend of Korra’s Korrasami, queer animation fans have gotten used to getting the short end of the stick with their romances either being heavily implied or flatly denied. Online, you’ve become known as a soothsayer with your credits on shows like Monarch and Severance, with their queer representation. What went into your mind when writing an explicitly queer representation in one of the most prominent video game-adapted television shows between Caitlyn and Vi?\\nOverton: In the very first week of the writer room, I was like, “OK, where’s the romance in the show?” And [Linke and Yee] were like, “It’s going to be Cait and Vi. They’ve been hinted at in the game, but they’ve never been made canon. So we want our show to make them canon.” And I was like, “I can help you with that” because I always loved video games my whole life. I loved these big, massive IP shows and stories. And I think the first time I saw [The Last of Us:] Left Behind, I sobbed. I sobbed for like 24 hours straight because it felt like a queer relationship in a space that I had loved so much for so long. It’s really hard to recognize the absence of a thing, but then when you finally see it for the first time, that makes a huge difference to me to see and feel that.\\nFor me, it was just a huge responsibility to tell an epic series-long romance. We were going to make them endgame. So we had to make, for me, the most satisfying things are the journeys that are most difficult to come by. I was like, “Well, we’ve got to make this as hard as possible. If Caitlyn’s an enforcer, what if enforcers killed Vi’s parents?” That was something we invented in the first week of the room so they would have the hardest possible journey to come together.\\nBut we also needed to understand how they could fall in love. That needs to be based on mutual respect. The first hurdle we had was Caitlyn. She’s an enforcer [with] a life of privilege. She didn’t have to fight, but she chose to fight. Whereas Vi, for her whole life, felt like to get anything, she always had to fight. So, she could look at someone who didn’t have to fight and chose to fight anyway. That was the kernel of, “Oh, she could respect that in Caitlyn.” If we could find some reason that these two very opposite people could respect each other, then we could find a way to make them fall in love.\\nqueen of queens pic.twitter.com/E4IJpcM5FU\\n— mey (@cupc444it) December 4, 2024\\nio9: Can you describe what it was like seeing the giant CaitVi mural in Brazil?\\nOverton: No (laughs)! It was so overwhelming. I couldn’t even find words for it. It really was. The mural at the finale event when the scene of them getting together finally happens—the sex scene—the fan reaction was the loudest of the entire end of the series. It was as loud as a jet engine, the sound guy told me.\\nTo see people cheering so much for two queer characters to get together, that’s never happened to me before. You see a giant mural of two women in love in the center of a giant city. That’s never happened to me before. My 16-year-old self, who felt awkward and weird and loved video games and Star Wars, and never felt like she belonged. If she saw this, she would feel like she belonged.\\xa0That’s the reason I write stories now, so it means the world to me.\\n© Netflix / Fortiche\\nio9: One point of contention fans have had with the season is its pacing in the second act. Many fans were hoping Caitlyn’s turn to fascism would last longer and be challenged in a big way—likely by Ekko (though he’s noticeably absent). Caitlyn does come to grips with her fall from grace by saying “I know” rather than “I’m sorry” when Vi holds her feet to the fire in their confrontation in act three. What does Caitlyn’s “I know” signify to you?\\nOverton: I think we always try to show with actions—I think actions are far more powerful than words. So we always knew that Caitlyn’s apology to Vi would take place in the way she was able to forgive Jinx. She had Jinx in custody. She could have gotten the justice that she always wanted. Instead, she chooses Vi. In letting Vi escape and have the key, there’s a world where Vi and Jinx disappear, and she never sees either of them again. So she very selflessly gave up anything she wanted at that moment to try and take an action that would be doing the right thing—that would be atoning for those mistakes.\\nLike she says, you can never take back the mistakes. You can only try to make up for them. And so, I think that “I know” is her acknowledging to everyone that “I made mistakes, and I can’t take them back, but I can certainly take action to try and fix that.” And in the end, she gives her eye. She’s willing to die and give her eye to try again, to try and keep making up for those mistakes.\\nio9: Maddie was a character Arcane fans loved to hate this season because she served as Caitlyn’s rebound from Vi. From a writer’s perspective, was Maddie’s purpose in the show—to give fans something to hate, or was there an added layer of reasoning to put her as a foil to Caitlyn and Vi’s romance?\\nOverton: The biggest romances need obstacles. One of the things that Caitlyn was struggling with this season was, “Who am I now that my mom’s gone and I’m the head of the Kiramman family? Do I have to do what my mom wanted me to do? Do I have to\\xa0 live the Kiramman name like my mom did, or can I make it my own?” And so, in the beginning, she leans into the council and the leadership that her mom did. I didn’t just want it to be professional, I wanted it to also be personal. What would it look like if she dated someone her mom might’ve approved of? And so, I think for her, she’s trying on things to see if they fit and realizes they don’t. And that helps her understand what she really wants.\\nio9: Obviously, this interview has become the CaitVi interview, so I’ve got you cornered here to ask some of those questions. It goes without saying that Caitlyn and Vi always dug each other in the first season, whether it be through visual tells like their many microexpressions, stolen glances at each other, match-frame shots. This season ramped things up in a big way in a scene where Caitlyn held Vi prisoner and—instead of whipping Vi’s spit away from her mouth like a normal person—Caitlyn wiped it across her lips. It behooves me to ask, did you have a hand in concocting that scene? And if so, what was going through either person’s mind at that moment?\\nOverton: The spit scene or the sex scene?\\nio9: The spit scene. We’ll get to the other one.\\n© Netflix / Fortiche\\nOverton: I think a storyboard artist or an animator did that. That’s not something that I had a hand in. The whole team knew from the beginning that this couple was gonna be the endgame. There were 400 people working on the show, pitching ideas and figuring out ways to make them together from the length of time they embrace to which direction they move their hands. Every single person was in on this together. That’s another reason there are so many special little moments between them: because it was such a team effort to bring this to life.\\nio9: Now we’ve arrived at the sex talk! Arcane’s eighth episode sees Caitlyn and Vi finally culminating their romance. Were there any hard lines or notes you had as deal breakers for how the intimacy of the love scene would be depicted, and what it absolutely needed to have incorporated into it? If so, what and why?\\nOverton: Another person that really helped bring that to life was the storyboard artist, Silvia [Martelossi]. She, like everybody, put all of their ideas of what they wanted to see in there. Our guiding light was that this was the culmination of love and a romantic relationship in our series, so it had to be better than that Jayce and Mel sex scene. It had to show more. It had to bring to life everything that these characters were and had done.\\nI always approach writing a sex scene the same way I approach writing an action scene [and] a dialogue scene. There have to be dramatic twists and turns that happen in that action that reveals something about the characters, from how playful they are, how vulnerable they are, and the way they look at each other. Every single moment of that, you had to learn something new about their relationship. It says a lot about the action of the apology, the action of Cait having regret for having hit Vi at the end of episode three. All of that is in there. That’s why I’m really proud of how much that scene says about them, the climax of their arcs, and the forgiveness that they’re both willing to have for each other in that moment. To me, that the most important thing to do.\\nAnd again, that whole team came together. Our storyboard artist, Silvia, really worked hard. She crafted a lot of wonderful beats, [and gave them] a lot of texture there. The episode’s directors also helped. Christian, Alex, everybody had a say. They also really listened to me. They’re like, “Amanda, what do you think?” And I was like, “Well, as the lesbian in the room, what about this?” And they respected, helped, empowered, and rallied around me to make it feel as authentic as it could. I know everyone has a different perspective, but to me, it felt like something the world hadn’t seen before in a story like a big video game IP. They just didn’t exist. I think we were able to put every single thing into that scene that we wanted to put into it.\\n© Netflix / Fortiche\\nio9: What is the significance of their first time being in a jail cell?\\nOverton: Honestly, the first time that was pitched to me—it wasn’t my original idea—I was like, “Really, the jail cell?” Whenever you strongly react to something, I think that’s an indication that you need to lean into it and explore. That’s what storytelling is: having strong emotional reactions to something and then figuring out why. And I was like, “Oh, well, this could be a way for Vi to reclaim that space for herself and use that to work through some of her past trauma or to reframe things that had been negative in her life to something positive.” I was like, “We’re gonna have to work really hard, you guys, to make this the right place for this moment.” I think with the lighting, the framing, and the way that the directors orchestrated everything felt beautiful.\\nWhen we got to see her tattoo for the first time—everyone wanted to see her whole tattoo— I was like, “Well, that’s gonna happen in that scene.” The way we reveal that got to be really beautiful and special for both of them—Cait’s reaction to seeing my tattoo [and] Cait’s reaction to everything in that moment. Everybody worked really hard to make that location work and I think everyone has a visceral reaction to that. That’s what you want as a writer. You want your audience to feel something visceral when they see something. So I was really proud of the team for making that work.\\nio9: Aside from CaitVi, Arcane season two has also done stellar work with other dynamics—with confirmed ships like Jinx and Ekko or an implied alt-universe romance between Silco and Vander. But one of the biggest ships to come out of Arcane outside of CaitVi is a ship between Jayce and Viktor, thanks in major part to the intimacy of their writing throughout the show and how they go out, as the fans say, in a “cosmic yaoi” style. Was the writing of Jayce and Viktor’s relationship intended to be strictly platonic, or are fans justified in reading it as romantic?\\nOverton: Fans are always justified in reading things the way they want to because that’s part of making art. When you do a thing for it based on you, it doesn’t actually have meaning until other people give it their own meaning. My backstory is very different from your backstory and my experiences are very different from yours so I can only speak from my experience. When I put a thing that I’ve written out in the world, then everyone brings their own different experiences to it.\\nWe were writing them as a loving, brotherly relationship that unambiguously [had] love between them. When it got to that final moment, it was so romantic and beautiful to me when I saw it for the first time—the way Fortiche put it together—I was like, “Oh, well maybe there is hope [for] these guys to have some future beyond what the show intended.” That was really cool for me to see. If people want to imagine that, I think they can, and that’s wonderful. Now that the show is over, if there’s the potential for that out there, then that’s potential that our fans can realize for themselves.\\n© Netflix / Fortiche\\nio9: On Twitter, you mentioned that episode seven, “Pretend Like It’s the First Time,” was your favorite episode. Going by the outpouring of fan art and Stormae’s song topping the global charts, it’s safe to say the feeling is mutual. What makes the episode such a standout for you as a writer?\\nOverton: What makes it such a standout is that you really can only do a standalone or an episode that exists outside the structure of a show when you successfully establish the structure of a show. We were able to come up with a very consistent version of how Arcane feels, how Arcane is paced, and the stories that we’re telling. Then we were able to step outside of that for one episode and make something a little bit different than what Arcane is: something more hopeful, something more colorful, and something kind of more of a rom-com. It still has all the seeds of Arcane, but I always called it the ’90s romance episode of Arcane. I was like, “Yes, that’s something I can totally do. Teen romance, I love it.”\\nWe’ve seen a lot of alternate universes now and how string theory has percolated with the Marvel infinite universe television shows doing that. We said, “Let’s take that and do our version.” Because everyone’s so familiar with this right now, we don’t have to spend much time explaining the multiverse. People will just instantly get “multiverse,” which means we can lean into what the potential of this relationship could be.\\n© Netflix / Fortiche\\nEkko gets to see Benzo again; he gets to see Vander again, and he gets to see Milo and Clagger if they grew up. And most importantly, he gets to see a version of Powder who grew up not becoming Jinx. I think [that’s] what was great about that episode. We got to see and imagine a future for all these characters that didn’t have one in our series. For Powder in particular, we got to show that there’s always some Jinx in Powder. Which is important because in the other timeline we got to show that there’s always gonna be some Powder in Jinx.\\nThat was exciting for us, to be able to give more depth to both of those characters and give Ekko everything he needs in the other timeline to kind of complete his arc. He got disillusioned with the darkness of Zaun and from having to fight so long. We were able to use the romance and love in that episode to bring hope back into Ekko’s life so that he would be fighting from a place of hope again.\\n© Netflix / Fortiche\\nio9: Endings are hard, though it’s a testament to the show and your writing that the major complaint from a majority of fans is that they wish they had more time with the show. If you could expand anything from the show, what element of the show would you have liked to have had more time exploring and why?\\nOverton: The second season took four years for us to write and produce. So, we combed over and spent a lot of time putting in every scene we thought was important, tracking every arc [and] storyline that we could. We’re very proud of how much all of those stories landed for people and how people felt emotional connection and understanding of the arcs that we chose to tell. It’s wonderful to hear that people’s biggest complaint is they wish they had more time with these characters. That’s a very flattering, humbling thing for a writer to feel like we’ve crafted characters and stories that people resonate with so much and so deeply.\\nIf I could just write a novel or write something else outside of the context of Arcane, I really loved Viktor’s character. He had one of the biggest arcs in the whole series. I would want to dive into his mindset a little bit more and his past. We had a lot of ideas about who he was when he lived in Zaun, who his parents were, [and] how that shaped who he was. So, maybe the Viktor backstory novel would be something that would be interesting.\\n© Netflix / Fortiche\\nio9: What does Caitlyn’s question about Vi “still being in the fight” mean to you?\\nOverton: I think the best endings have always left things unsaid and open to interpretation. Those are the endings where I’m like, “But what did they mean by that?”\\xa0 I was like, “Ooh, we nailed that final line.” So many people think one thing, but other people can think another thing about Jinx’s fate and things like that, and why they made the choices they made. But I think what Caitlyn [said], what I took away from that was, the things that they have to do are just beginning rather than being over.\\nThe characters are quite young in our series. They’re like in their early 20s or 20 years old. And me being in my 40s, I’m like, “That’s a whole ‘nother lifetime with things that you guys have to do together.” And the things that I’ve learned in the past 20 years, I’d say that’s most of what I’ve learned in my whole life. So we wanted to say that their stories are just beginning together and what they’re going to do next is—it’s kind of now up to the audience to decide and imagine.\\n© Fortiche / Rael Lyra\\nio9: You’re set to develope Fortiche’s upcoming sci-fi Greek mythology story, Penelope of Sparta. What should fans expect out of the series given what you’ve accomplished with Arcane?\\nOverton: We’re trying to use that the signature Fortiche style to develop a new IP that they do on their own. This was an idea that Fortiche had that they came to me and pitched. They wanted to do a prequel to The Odyssey. They wanted to do something set in a Greek mythology-inspired world, but with the Fortiche twist on it.\\nWe’ve been working on that project now for a year, developing what’s the story that we like in a different world that isn’t the Runeterra and League of Legends universe. I think you can expect romance, you can expect trauma, and tragedy. Like all good Greek epics, it is about how a personal family story affects the political on a big scale. You can expect a lot of tragedy with a little bit of hope.\\nio9: With Arcane bookended, what are your hopes moving forward for future writing projects? Are there any dream projects in the wings?\\nOverton: Obviously, Arcane was a dream project for me, to get to work on a video game adaptation being such a big video game fan. [Arcane is] such a huge expansive massive world-building show. Those are things I love to bring to life. Getting to have that canon queer couple as at the center of the show, those are all my boxes checked off in one project. But I think moving forward, I would like opportunities to tell more stories in spaces like that. There’s been a lot of really great adaptations of video games coming out recently. I’m really excited by the potential future storytelling for those adaptations and I hope that Arcane can kind of pave the way and open the door to get to do more stories like that.\\nAll episodes of Arcane are streaming on Netflix.\\nWant more io9 news?

Despite the physical limitations caused by the disorder, Mats lived a rich life in the online World of Warcraft game – where his avatar was the powerfully built, able-bodied Ibelin. In that setting, Mats made many friends and impacted people far and wide, but his parents had no idea of their son’s vibrant virtual experiences until after his passing at the age of 25.\\nRelated Stories\\nAcquisitions\\nNetflix Snaps Up Sundance Doc ‘Ibelin’ From ‘The Painter And The Thief’ Helmer Benjamin Ree\\nDocumentary\\nAnatomy Of A Scene: ‘Piece By Piece’ Filmmakers Break Down How You Turn Real Pharrell Williams Into LEGO Pharrell\\nMats Steen in ‘Ibelin’ Bjørg Engdahl/Netflix\\n“The whole idea here is to find a structure that says something about grief,” Ree says of the narrative challenge. “And it does have what I call a symphonic, circular structure. And when I say symphonic, I mean that we tell the story like five to six times. [Initially], it’s basically told in the opening credits. Then it’s told by the family; it’s a traditional family, so they get a traditional form — talking heads and archive. Then it’s told again by Mats, and every time we tell a story from a different perspective, we get a new form. Mats gets this stream of consciousness montage kind of form. Then the film suddenly becomes an animated film. It’s told through Ibelin… The last time we tell this story, at the funeral, is told verbally.”\\nWatch on Deadline\\nPondering how to structure such a complex narrative, Ree turned the page to a Nobel Prize-winning American author.\\n“Some of it is inspired by the structure from Absalom, Absalom! by William Faulkner,” he reveals. “That [novel] is told many times from different perspectives.”\\nAuthor William Faulkner (right) receives the 1949 Nobel Prize for literature from King Gustaf Adolf VI of Sweden. Photo by © CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images\\nFurther inspiration came from an analysis of another Faulkner classic.\\n“The Sound and the Fury; according to Faulkner, he tried to tell the story many times and he needed to include every of them from the different brothers. I think the level of complexity when you then tell the story from different brothers’ [perspectives] but set in different times and different forms each time, it’s a genius way of telling the story. And then the last chapter is a third person narrator that sees everything… The idea of having different kind of viewpoints, we do that in The Remarkable Life of Ibelin. And the last scene is at the funeral and then it’s told from a third-person view.”\\nMats Steen’s avatar Ibelin (right) in ‘The Remarkable Life of Ibelin’ World of Warcraft and Blizzard Ent.\\nFor his film, Ree was able to draw from home videos of Mats Steen and from digital logs that tracked all of Mats’s interactions within the World of Warcraft environment. With help from an animator, the director reconstructed the moment-to-moment way Steen played the game and with whom he interacted.\\n“A unique story needs a unique form,” the filmmaker observes. “In [the documentary] you have a film within the film, which is the virtual world… an actual lived avatar life. That’s a coming-of-age story.”\\nHe adds, “There’s a section where time passes by. We are rewinding it, but 10 years passes by very, very quickly. So, it’s all of these formal ideas. A lot of them I take from literature. The rewinding of the tapes is very inspired by To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf.”\\nAnother author Ree reveres – the famed Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky.\\n“One of my favorite books of all time is The Brothers Karamazov. And how that is structured is super interesting… The way the story floats, it’s like going down a river — you don’t know which direction it will go. It feels very free in the storytelling,” he says. “In a lot of forced dramaturgy, you know where the story will go. And in The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, we try to make that feeling of you don’t know… Not everything needs to be strict.”\\nReferencing a line attributed variously to Faulkner, Hemingway, George Orwell, or Oscar Wilde, Ree says, “You don’t need to ‘kill all your darlings,’ you need to have a lot of your darlings as well to give it air and keep it surprising, I think. So that’s the idea. And it’s not always easy to do that in film because you have shorter time. But I do like it when stories are unexpected, surprising, but I think it should also do that in form.”\\nDirector Benjamin Ree at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival Awards Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\\nAt the Sundance Film Festival, where the documentary premiered, it won the Audience Award for World Cinema Documentary, and Ree won the Directing Award in that category. It has won numerous prizes around the world, including Best Film at the Amanda Awards in Ree’s (and Mats Steen’s) native country of Norway. The film has been a big hit there.\\n“We had a theatrical [release] in Norway, 120,000 people watched it in the cinemas, which is a lot. It’s like 4 percent of our population of people over 10 years old,” he notes. “In Norway, I met teenagers that came up to me after screenings. A 15-year-old said, ‘I don’t have any friends in real life. All of my friends are in the virtual world, through gaming, and thank you so much for making this film. Now I can show it to my parents, and they will understand my life better.’”\\nGreat literature stands the test of time, but there are ways in which the medium of cinema can eclipse the written word – at least, say, a news story drafted about the remarkable life of Mats Steen.\\n“That’s the great thing about documentary films and films in general — you can tell stories visually and emotionally — something different than reading about it descriptively,” Ree observes. “And I think that makes the audience resonate and understand. There’s many different ways of understanding.

Throughout the 2024 campaign, their ads demonized trans participation in public life. Their wedge issue of choice? A distorted view of women’s sport.\\nTrump led the way. He voiced lies about transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and about a San Jose State volleyball player who may have been outed as transgender by her teammate. His rancor didn’t stop at transgender athletes: He spread hateful misinformation about nontrans Olympic boxer Imane Khelif, too.\\nEven though Democrats did little to challenge transphobic Republican talking points, some commentators now argue that supporting transgender and gender nonconforming athletes is a mistake. This is the wrong conclusion. The weaponized obsession with policing women’s sports is new — it is manufactured, it is spiteful and it should be disarmed.\\nRepublicans have exploited rhetoric about restricting women’s sport, but they did not invent it. They join a reactionary chorus of current and former athletes, academics and athletes’ parents.\\nWe must reject the trans-exclusionary story these figures peddle about women and sport. It hurts trans, intersex and gender nonconforming people and it deflects attention away from the issues that do threaten women and girls in athletics. There is every reason to foster alliances — not enmity — between all women athletes, in the interest of combatting gender-based injustice in the sports world and beyond (Just listen to Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe).\\nSex is not common sense\\nWhat do I mean by the trans-exclusionary story? We can start close to home. Thomas L. Perkins Distinguished Professor of Law Doriane Coleman is prominent in the movement to restrict women’s sport according to a binary interpretation of the category “sex.” She has written a book about the topic, “On Sex and Gender: A Commonsense Approach,” as well as numerous op-eds and articles. In 2019 she testified to congress. She is a frequent podcast guest. Unpacking the problems with her thinking can help us understand what is misguided and hurtful about this narrative.\\nThe core of Coleman’s argument, as she presents it in this work, is that “the basic facts [of sex and gender] are universal and timeless.” For her, sex is “dimorphic,” immutable and easy to determine. Gender is separate from sex; not all women are female. And because of innate sex-based performance inferiorities, in the world of competitive sport, it is only fair for females to compete against other females. This is why she believes that transgender women and women with intersex conditions threaten “extraordinary harm.” Their participation in elite sport, she asserts, sacrifices competitors with a “female’s body” as “collateral damage” and it is “bad for women and girls when we pretend otherwise.”\\nThe problem with this story begins with the meaning of sex. As historians of science like Beans Velocci and Jules Gill-Peterson and biological anthropologists like Alexandra Kralick show, sex is not such a simple thing. Is sex fixed before birth, or at puberty, or can it change? What matters in determining sex: genitalia, hormones, chromosomes, internal organs, reproductive capacity, appearance or bones? “The more scientists have studied sex,” Velocci argues, “the more contradictions the category has come to contain.”\\nColeman’s work does not reckon with this complexity. She describes her work as “sex smart,” yet fails to engage with research that challenges “common sense” beliefs. One consequence is the undercount of people born with intersex traits, people whose bodies don’t fit tidily in categories of male and female. In the sports context, these people are often described as having “disorders of sexual development” (DSD).\\nIn her book, Coleman claims that the incidence of people with intersex conditions is “truly tiny,” “only about 0.02 percent of humans.” The source for this is a bit muddled, but the nearest citation is of an advocacy group called Intersex Human Rights Australia (IHRA). IHRA staunchly argues that “the actual numbers of people with intersex variations are likely to be as much as 1.7 percent,” 85 times higher than what Coleman asserts. Coleman admits that her numbers are “contested by some,” and that “it’s been suggested … that 1.7 percent (not 0.02 percent) [of humans] are exceptional.” But she fails to substantively engage the arguments of scholars who advance the higher percentage, and she dismisses the reasons why IHRA advocates for the higher number as a “philosophical gambit.”\\nOn fairness in sport\\nWhen human bodies defy binary sex — as many do — sport governing organizations inevitably run into difficulties policing the female/not female line. One solution is to trust people when they say who they are. We could listen to Olympic gold medalist Caster Semenya, for example, who explains that although she has been diagnosed with an intersex condition because of how her “internal organs are structured,” she is a woman and “an elite female athlete.” The borders of “female” are subjective because sex as a category is not coherent.\\nTransgender athletes also challenge efforts to segregate sports by sex. Gender-affirming treatments bring about complex bodily changes, exposing how chromosomes are not destiny. And further, trans perspectives illuminate how categories of sex and gender are anything but neutral descriptions of reality — they are ideological and historical technologies of population management.\\nWhat does this mean for fairness? Coleman insists that there is a “biologically driven performance gap between males and females” and so people who have experienced the “constructive effects of the Y chromosome and male puberty” cannot fairly compete against people who haven’t.\\nThe evidence is more dubious. Athleticism can’t be reduced solely to quantifiable factors like testosterone. Every athlete’s body is a patchwork of genetic capacities — some are boons, others handicaps. Many of these qualities have nothing to do with sex, and indeed, women may have underrecognized advantages in some events. As such, there is ample disagreement about how to foster “meaningful competition” in women’s sport.\\nIt bears repeating that including transgender women and women with DSD in women’s sports is not the same as including men. Case studies show that transgender athletes encounter “very complex athletic advantages and disadvantages … when they switch teams.” When it comes to athletes with DSD, some scientists argue “we simply don’t have enough data” to assume unfair advantage.\\nMeanwhile, fairness is about more than biology. Bodies don’t compete in “some socially-neutral vacuum.” Athletes targeted for supposed deviation from femaleness face harassment, threats and violations of their privacy. Many nontrans women — especially women of color and queer women — are accused of being transgender because they do not conform to restrictive gender norms. The suspicious posture that Coleman models will only lead to more attacks on women athletes.\\nHonest reckoning with gender and sports performance must look beyond the individual bodies of competitors. It must be realistic about how trans-exclusionary arguments give cover for anti-trans hostility.\\nA failure of empathy\\nRead more\\nA love letter to Duke fitness classes: Rediscovering the joy of movement\\nReflections on the greatest war criminal in American history\\nBeyond red and blue\\nColeman does sometimes lay out a more nuanced case for exclusion and inclusion. In “On Sex and Gender,” she distinguishes between policies for competitive and non-competitive sport, and she has been publicly critical of blanket bans on transgender athletes. But a drawback to Coleman’s inclusiveness is that the kinds of accommodations she argues are necessary to allow transgender girls to compete “when prizes, podiums, championships, and records are at stake” — namely hormone therapy — are becoming less accessible to trans youth across the country.\\nPragmatically, then, Coleman continues to argue for banning transgender youth from the parts of sport that, elsewhere, she positions as fundamental to sport’s value: a chance to win at the top level, to do more than “try out for the team and go home with a participation ribbon.”\\nColeman argues that if transgender women or women with DSD succeed, “female” athletes will be “robbed” of “the opportunities to be role models for little girls who need to see strong, victorious females so that they can dream big dreams themselves.” Why is it so obvious that girls would reject being inspired by transgender champions like CeCé Telfer or Lia Thomas? These are awesome women athletes. And what about little transgender girls (and boys), or girls with DSD? Have they no right to witness people like them succeeding, and to succeed themselves?\\nThis is a failure of empathy that defines the trans-exclusionary position. It goes deeper: Coleman positions transgender and intersex women as threats, but she waves off the threats these communities face.\\nTake her discussion of bathrooms and locker rooms. In “On Sex and Gender,” Coleman cites a U.N. report to argue that it makes sense for “females” to be wary about “male sexual violence in places where they go to relieve themselves.” This report makes no claims that transgender women are a threat to other women in bathrooms. (Empirically, such claims are baseless.) While she has stated that she supports transgender women utilizing women’s bathrooms, Coleman insists that “we need to respect” the fears that some other people may hold that transgender women in women’s bathrooms and locker rooms threaten women’s “physical safety and privacy interests,” that these fears are “protective instincts” we should not dismiss.\\nWho do these instincts protect? Trans people routinely face violence when trying to use the bathroom – the notion that they are a danger is part of what endangers them. Justifying anxieties about imagined bathroom assaults is inconsistent with Coleman’s claims that she’s “an ally to trans people.” It is irresponsible to adopt positions that impact trans people without considering what community trans organizations tell you about that advocacy.\\nThe trans-exclusionary story ignores the real harms women athletes face\\nUnlike the craven legislators who draw upon her work, I believe Professor Coleman cares deeply about women’s sport. But I also think she has made herself available, using the prestige of the institution for which we both work, to nefarious forces that would see trans people disappear. Sport continues to be a cornerstone of escalating anti-trans legislation. Duke administrators should be clear-eyed about the trans-exclusionary impacts of these positions.\\nIt does not have to be this way. The policies that Coleman advocates target a “vanishingly short” list of athletes – transgender athletes are in fact “underrepresented.” Like sports scientist Joanna Harper, I believe we “should try to find some method that maximizes the possibility that all women can enjoy equitable and meaningful sport.” The obstacles to this vision are not transgender women or women with DSD. The preoccupation with restricting the category “female” ignores the serious, structural and intersectional patterns of sexist harm that impact huge numbers of women and girls.\\nTrans and nontrans women athletes both face gender-based violence. They confront sexual coercion and harassment, constrained economic opportunities, rigid gender norms, inadequate legal protections. The disregard, complicity and cruelty of sporting authorities. Femicide. These are the forces that menace women athletes. Anti-trans policies do nothing to address them. Instead, these policies weaken what could be the grounds of robust, coalitional anti-violence organizing.\\nThe trans-exclusionary story undercuts what is beautiful and joyous about sport, replacing potential allyship with anger and resentment.\\nJoseph Hiller is a Ph.D. Candidate in Cultural Anthropology with a Certificate in Feminist Studies.\\nGet The Chronicle straight to your inbox\\nSignup for our weekly newsletter.

However, these attributes often perpetuate barriers that exclude talented individuals, particularly those with disabilities.\\nAccording to a report by the National Association of Law Placement (NALP), only 0.53% of attorneys self-reported as having a disability. This staggering statistic underscores the systemic challenges that individuals with disabilities face within the profession.\\nDisability inclusion is more than a matter of fairness; it is a catalyst for innovation and equity.\\nUnderstanding the Landscape\\nAutistic adults generally experience the lowest overall employment rates among all disabled populations. This trend is reflective of broader workplace barriers and stigmas.\\n“People with disabilities who are able and willing to work still have trouble finding a job,” ... [+] Kennedy notes. “Young people with disabilities often don’t envision themselves in the legal profession because they don’t see people like them represented.”\\nAP2018\\nTed Kennedy, Jr., a prominent disability rights activist and amputee, emphasizes that despite the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) being over 30 years old, workforce participation for people with disabilities remains stagnant.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### iOS 18.2—Update Now Warning Issued To All iPhone Users\\n### Microsoft Warns 400 Million Windows Users—Do Not Update Your PC\\n### Selena Gomez And Benny Blanco Are Engaged—And The Internet Has Opinions\\n“People with disabilities who are able and willing to work still have trouble finding a job,” Kennedy notes. “Young people with disabilities often don’t envision themselves in the legal profession because they don’t see people like them represented.”\\nRepresentation—or the lack thereof—plays a significant role in perpetuating exclusion. Kennedy likens this issue to the challenges women faced entering finance decades ago: “There were no prominent women in finance, and the assumption was that women didn’t know anything about money. Similarly, young people with disabilities need mentors and role models in the legal profession to envision what their lives could be like.”\\nSystemic Barriers and Their Impact\\nSystemic barriers for lawyers with disabilities often begin at the law school level. Haley Moss, Esq., an autistic attorney, highlights the unique challenges faced by neurodivergent law students.\\nSystemic barriers for lawyers with disabilities often begin at the law school level. Haley Moss, ... [+] Esq., an autistic attorney, highlights the unique challenges faced by neurodivergent law students.\\nTalilly Photography\\n“Law students with mental health disabilities and neurodivergent students feel as if they cannot receive support without jeopardizing their bar admissions process,” Moss explains. “Thirty states and D.C. ask about a person’s mental health history in the character and fitness questions for bar admission. That alone deters people with disabilities from sharing they ever have a disability.”\\nAdditionally, the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) historically flagged scores for individuals who received accommodations, sending a message that their achievements were less legitimate. While this practice has been abolished, it represents a long history of systemic exclusion.\\nOnce in the profession, lawyers with disabilities face stigma from peers, judges, and clients. “Disabled litigators do not want to be perceived as weak or less than by opposing counsel, judges, witnesses, or jurors,” Moss adds. “This makes advocating for ourselves more difficult.”\\nStrategies for Change\\nThe Disability Equality Index (DEI), developed by the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) and Disability:IN, is a benchmarking tool for companies to evaluate their disability inclusion efforts. According to Kennedy, only seven of the top 200 law firms in the U.S. are currently engaged with the DEI.\\n“We need to encourage law firms to participate in initiatives like the DEI,” Kennedy says. “By identifying best practices and showcasing successful firms, we can create a ripple effect that inspires others to follow suit.”\\nFlexible work policies have proven transformative for many individuals with disabilities. Moss notes that these policies benefit not only disabled professionals but also working parents, caregivers, and those without reliable transportation.\\n“Remote and flexible work policies create a more inclusive and accessible environment for everyone,” she says. “Technology, such as videoconferencing with closed captions, enhances accessibility and fosters collaboration.”\\nOnly 55% of companies offer centralized accommodation funds, so there is significant room for ... [+] improvement in how accommodations are handled within the legal profession.\\ngetty\\nOnly 55% of companies offer centralized accommodation funds, so there is significant room for improvement in how accommodations are handled within the legal profession. Moss suggests partnering with organizations such as Protection & Advocacy and Lawyers Assistance Programs to identify and address the unique needs of disabled lawyers.\\nChanging perceptions begins with education. Moss emphasizes the importance of continued education to reduce stigma and bias. “Recognize that neurodivergence isn’t just autism, ADHD, and learning disabilities but also includes mental health conditions and intellectual disabilities that often face even greater stigma.”\\nMentorship programs can also play a pivotal role. By providing young people with disabilities access to mentors in the legal field, law schools, and firms can inspire a new generation of lawyers to pursue their dreams.\\nAdvancing Disability Inclusion\\nAdvancing disability inclusion in the legal profession is not just a moral imperative but a ... [+] strategic one.\\ngetty\\nAdvancing disability inclusion in the legal profession is not just a moral imperative but a strategic one. By addressing systemic barriers, adopting inclusive policies, and fostering representation, the legal industry can create a more equitable and innovative future.\\nAs Kennedy aptly states, “People with disabilities are loyal employees who bring unique perspectives to the table. They deserve the chance to participate fully in society.”\\nThe path forward requires collective action from law schools, firms, and advocacy organizations. Together, we can break down barriers and ensure that the legal profession truly represents the diversity of the communities it serves.\\nFollow me on\\xa0Twitter\\xa0or\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website.\\nJennifer Jay Palumbo\\nFollowing\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\nOne Community.

Do These Pictures Hold the Same Weight Now?\\nSarah Lewis’s New Book Shows How Photography Taught Americans to “See” Race\\nLearning from Lagos: Lessons from the Megalopolis’s Growing Art Scene\\nView All\\nDecember 13, 2024 5:00am\\nPete Souza: President Obama allowing a child, Jacob Philadelphia, to touch his head, 2013. From Race Stories: Essays on the Power of Images, 2024. © Pete Souza/The White House\\nFor 10 years, the critic and educator\\xa0Maurice Berger\\xa0wrote a column for the\\xa0New York Times\\xa0titled “Race Stories.” Writing about photographs, he wanted to teach visual literacy, and then “racial literacy through visual literacy.” The column championed the work of photographers, like\\xa0Jamel Shabazz, Zanele Muholi, Carrie Mae Weems, Nona Faustine,\\xa0and\\xa0Gordon Parks,\\xa0whose projects—whether of social documentary or artistic exploration—impressed Berger.\\nThis month, a collection of nearly 70 of those short essays is being published by Aperture, in collaboration with the\\xa0New York Times,\\xa0the first in a “Vision and Justice” series of books edited by\\xa0Sarah Lewis, Deborah Willis,\\xa0and\\xa0Leigh Raiford.\\xa0Berger, who died of Covid in the early days of the pandemic, liked to “write about photographers who tell big stories—not just about the conflagrations… but about what happens every single day in the lives of others,” as he put it in 2018. Edited by\\xa0Marvin Heiferman,\\xa0a writer, curator, and Berger’s widow,\\xa0Race Stories: Essays on the Power of Images\\xa0is thoughtfully arranged in five sections based on themes woven from Berger’s ideological threads: revisiting images, visibility, history and memory, witnessing, and community.\\nRelated Articles\\nTamara de Lempicka\\'s Seductive Views of the \"Roaring \\'20s\" Are the Subject of a Retrospective, a Biopic, and a Broadway Musical\\nBarbara Probst\\'s Photographs Make You Feel the Limits of Knowing\\nZun Lee: Bedtime shenanigans with Carlos Richardson and his daughter Selah, 2012. From Race Stories: Essays on the Power of Images, 2024. Courtesy the artist\\nBerger’s multiyear column possesses a sustained inner chutzpah that will be especially noticeable to anyone who has written professionally and consistently about art for any significant length of time. The dizzying amount of press releases, constraints of word count, the need to balance personal and house styles: a minimum trifecta of considerations that he would have had to deal with, month after month. He remained on message with obvious dedication; it must have helped that there was always material to work with.\\nIn almost every essay, Berger examines the photographers and their work in adulatory fashion. This is notable. Could this have been because his “greatest passion is to be an educator,” as he says in the foreword? It would have been odd if he were to criticize the work of Black or Indian or Chicana or Japanese photographers, while asking white readers to empathize with their perspectives. But praise is not the absence of conscientiousness, which Berger excelled in. One should only consider how he wrote about figures or images likely familiar to his readers—Joane Wilson\\xa0in front of a “colored entrance” sign,\\xa0Malcolm X\\xa0reading a newspaper,\\xa0Martin Luther King Jr.\\xa0in a conversation with his daughter,\\xa0Brittany Bree Newsome\\xa0removing a Confederate flag—then re-examined those momentous pictures, carefully assembling cultural and historical data. In “The Faces of Bigotry,” for instance, he draws parallels between\\xa0Samuel Corum’s\\xa02017 photograph of Peter Cvjetanovic, marching alongside others at a counterprotest led by neo-Nazis, White Supremacists, and the Alt-Right at the University of Virginia; and the 1957 image by\\xa0Will Counts\\xa0of students shouting insults at Elizabeth Eckford as she attempts to integrate a high school in Arkansas.\\nDeborah Willis: Carrie in EuroSalon, Eaton, Florida, 2004. From Race Stories: Essays on the Power of Images, 2024. Courtesy the artist\\nHe did not spare chastisement, however, when writing about\\xa0Dana Schutz’s\\xa0painterly interpretation of\\xa0Emmett Till’s\\xa0open casket, which reads, says Berger, “like it was made in a historical and cultural vacuum,” and felt like “another violation” of the teenager’s body. His interest in Schutz’s cross-cultural work—and indeed in other white photographers whose images he wrote about, like\\xa0Lee Friedlander\\xa0and\\xa0Florence Mars\\xa0—is notable for what it says about how he viewed himself as a Jewish American writing mostly about Black photographers. “Cross-cultural work demands insight, respect, sensitivity, and rigor. It also requires honesty about and self-inquiry into one’s own racial attitudes,” he wrote in that 2017 essay about Till’s image.\\nI speak about Berger’s identity because his writing examined race and its visualizing in photography. His essays, taken as an oeuvre, make two key propositions: first, to write is to plumb the inner reserves of empathy, to uncover what you think or feel about those whose experience you need to understand. Second, writing on photography can help in particular because the writer is necessarily a respondent—a secondary figure rather than primary witness—thinking through what others have pictured, seeing others through the ways they see themselves.\\nLaToya Ruby Frazier: Grandma Ruby and Me, 2005. From Race Stories: Essays on the Power of Images, 2024. © LaToya Ruby Frazier, courtesy the artist and Gladstone Gallery\\nThat second idea is implied in Berger’s fidelity to photography. In a historical sense it is a medium that cannot escape its unsavory credentials, having been used to shape imperial or stereotypical narratives about the non-white subject. And yet, Berger’s investment was to account for those who work against the medium’s inherited baggage. Quoting\\xa0Anthony Barboza\\xa0in the book’s final essay on\\xa0Kamoinge,\\xa0the African American photography collective, Berger leaves us with a resonant notion: that photographers “absorb the feelings of the self and the world and reflect back what we see.”\\nRead More About:\\nMaurice Berger\\nReframed\\nMost-Read Stories\\n### Is Luxury Fashion Supporting the Arts or…\\n### Luna Luna, the Drake-Backed Art Amusement Park, Will Either…\\n### Look Mom!: When Photographers and Their…\\n### Remembering the Alchemical Sculptor and Performance Artist…\\nGet the Magazine\\nThe World\\'s Premier Art Magazine since 1913.

So I am very happy. The first three episodes when I was the purple princess, I was in my glory just loving watching my friends go on TV. I’m low-key pretty happy. It’s an amazing journey, amazing experience. But this part is for the fans, so I feel like the final four will get the time they deserve and I’m happy just to watch with my popcorn on my couch and be like, “This is what they should have done!”\\nDid you have a plan of how to contend with Sam ratting out your fake idol? And did you expect him to do that?\\nNo, I didn’t. It’s so crazy. I was guarded the entire game, which really helped me plan ahead, see things strategically. And then as soon as I started making friends, Sam, incredible, all of a sudden not guarding myself, assuming my friend’s not going to do this. It’s my own fault because I did not see myself as a threat. I didn’t see why he would be motivated to do that. So I had a total blind spot for that move because of the relationship and just how I wasn’t accurately perceiving myself. But yeah, I was not prepared.\\nWas there any way you and Sam could’ve concocted a plan to save both of you?\\nYes! This is the pitch I gave him: “Sam, let’s use this idol to spook them.” Now, here’s the problem with this plan though, because we didn’t know Sue had an idol. So this plan would have only worked against Teeny, and I really wanted to use it on Sue. But the plan is, “Sam, if they think this idol is real, they’re going to be nervous to pile the votes on one of us. Because if we play the idol correctly, we get to pick who goes home out of Sue and Teeny.” Even when Sam blew up my game, I was still trying to make that pitch to them and also to Teeny and say, “Guys, if we take out Sue, you’re both guaranteed to set at final tribal. Rachel and I got this issue with each other. We want to take each other out. You’re guaranteeing your spot.” But I didn’t see them thinking I was such a juicy target that they had to get me out.\\nDid the narrative about you being a huge target begin after you turned on Sol?\\nIt didn’t really manifest as everybody after Genevieve. It really only was Teeny. I think if Teeny didn’t have such an explosive reaction. I mean, you see in the episode, Gabe and Andy wanted to make it clear, like, “This is all Genevieve.” Very transparently setting it up to be like, ‘We’ll get her out next, right?’\\nTeeny and the big reaction they had and the discussions they had with people afterwards really fanned the flames. I think I could’ve mitigated that better. I think the timing was right for the Sol vote because even raising my threat level then it’s like, “Yeah, but Gabe’s here tomorrow. Kyle’s here tomorrow. Sam’s here tomorrow. People are going to be be more interested in these guys so they can call me a threat as much as they want, I still don’t think I’ll be the next one to go.”\\nWe saw you talk about how the Kishan vote affected you emotionally. Can you talk about that?\\nIt’s so interesting because I went into the game thinking I’ll have a couple ride-or-dies. There were things that happened early on Lavo beach that made it clear that I was really no one’s No 1. So I was like, “OK, I’ve just got to look out for myself.” And with the Kishan vote, his reaction afterwards, I guess I was just expecting everyone to be like, “It’s a game. Good game,” like compartmentalize it sort of the same way I had.\\nSo as people started to have these strong emotions of betrayal or hurt or Teeny when they’re furious with me, it’s so different than how I view the game and how I compartmentalize it. Those emotions felt so real and then I took them on and I was like, “But is it a game? If I’m hurting people, then that’s a personal thing and I wouldn’t want to do that.” So it’s difficult to reconcile, or at least it was for me.\\nHow would you have presented your case if you made it to final three?\\nI never practiced my case and I haven’t really thought about it that much since I never got there. I think what I would have tried to lay out and explain first and foremost is the journey and why I was so cold to people, because I think that would have mattered to some of the jurors. And then the way I look at it is sort of, there’s these three pillars of the game: social, strategic and strength. I had a decent performance in challenges, particularly at the end when I won one. Strategic I think would have spoken for itself. Social I would have been able to explain. So I would have hit on those themes and then just tried to be the best advocate I can and really pull up my lawyer skills. By then, the jury didn’t know I was a lawyer. So maybe I do like, “I’m a lawyer, and if anybody cares,” and they would be like, “We don’t care.”\\nAre you interested in returning for Season 50?\\nI believe that if anyone gets an opportunity to play “Survivor,” you should. It is the hardest thing you’ll do, but it’s also the most rewarding thing you’ll do. So if I got invited back, although I would be terrified because now I am very aware of how hard it is, I would say yes. Any time that they would ask me, I would want to be there.\\nThe “Survivor 47” finale airs next Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.\\nWhy McDonald's employee who reported Luigi Mangione might not get the $60K reward\\nLeBron James steps away from Lakers for 'personal reasons' as he plays some of the worst basketball of his career\\nMega Millions jackpot winner says he purchased both $394M prize tickets — but lost second one as he sues lottery\\nLuigi Mangione, suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson killing, was an ivy league grad with a grudge against the healthcare industry\\nDaniel Penny beams, courtroom erupts as Marine vet is acquitted in subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely\\nLive updates: Accused UnitedHealthcare CEO assassin Luigi Mangione silently walked out of courthouse after wild entrance\\nNow on\\nPage Six\\nJames Kennedy’s girlfriend, Ally Lewber, appears unfazed in first photos after news of ‘Vanderpump Rules’ star’s domestic violence arrest\\n53 celeb-worthy men’s luxury gift ideas to spoil him for Christmas 2024\\nDonald Trump Jr. brings Bettina Anderson to Mar-a-Lago dinner, are greeted by Donald Sr., ‘parading their love for all to see’\\nNow on\\t\\t\\t\\t Decider\\nA Thing Not To Do: Lily Phillips Breaks Down In Tears After She “Sleeps With” 100 Men in One Day\\nAdvertisement\\nMore Stories\\nPage Six\\nNYPost\"}], 'AI와 창작의 융합: 비디오 제작에서의 새로운 트렌드': [{'title': 'AI Videos Are Changing Media: Strengths, Limitations, And Potential - Forbes', 'image_url': 'https://img.etnews.com/news/article/2024/06/17/news-p.v1.20240617.f579191488c243499a901b5b8ff7a04d_P1.jpg', 'raw_content': \"AI Videos Are Changing Media: Strengths, Limitations, And Potential\\nSubscribe To Newsletters\\nBETA\\nTHIS IS A BETA EXPERIENCE.

[+] 10, 2024. (Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\\nNurPhoto via Getty Images\\nOpenAI’s Sora launched with overwhelming demand, forcing operations to pause within one day.\\nThis public enthusiasm underscores AI’s potential to revolutionize media. AI videos are set to transform how people engage with content by making it more interactive. Consumers who once passively consumed media can now easily create their own. No longer confined to text, sound, or static images, AI now generates short videos and is being explored for longer films, though challenges with accuracy and consistency remain.\\nCompanies such as Runway AI, Luma AI, Pika Labs, Meta, Hailuo AI, and among others, are at the forefront, racing to enhance their tools. Runway’s Act-One and Camera Control offer professional tools to add nuances to videos. Luma AI and Hailuo AI excel at animating figures from user-uploaded images, seamlessly transforming static visuals into dynamic scenes aligned with textual prompts. This empowers everyday users to experiment with creative ideas, stepping into the role of a producer or director effortlessly.\\nPotential of AI Videos Across Industry\\nAI video generators are reshaping industries like advertising, e-commerce, education, and entertainment by making content creation more dynamic, personalized, and accessible. In advertising, brands can produce localized and interactive campaigns tailored to diverse audiences without costly production teams. This trend is visible in the growth of AI video advertisement startups.\\nIn e-commerce, AI-generated videos can create immersive shopping experiences, turning static images into dynamic product showcases or crafting personalized promotion videos that boost engagement. In education, AI has the potential to bring complex concepts to life through explainer videos, virtual tours, or localized instructional content, expanding global access to learning.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n### iOS 18.2—Update Now Warning Issued To All iPhone Users\\n### Microsoft Warns 400 Million Windows Users—Do Not Update Your PC\\n### Selena Gomez And Benny Blanco Are Engaged—And The Internet Has Opinions\\nIn entertainment, filmmakers and musicians are experimenting with AI to produce fantastical visuals and animations, democratizing tools that were once limited to big-budget studios. For instance, the 2024 Tribeca Festival and OpenAI collaborated to debut five original short films. Runway AI held AI film festivals, and initiated the Hundred Film Fund, which will provide grants ranging from $5,000 up to $1 million to selected filmmakers using its technology.\\nAcross these fields, AI video technology is lowering barriers, enabling creativity, and transforming how businesses and individuals engage with media. While AI video tools increase efficiency and allow small budget productions, they also raise an important question: How can we preserve human touch and meaningful stories?\\nStrengths and Challenges of AI Video Generators\\nAI video generators are particularly strong at creating surreal and fantastical visuals, similar to the revolutionary art movements of Dadaism and Surrealism. They allow creators to produce scenes that would be impossible in real life, opening new avenues for storytelling.\\nFor instance, the Toronto-based pop band Shy Kids created a short film titled “Air Head,” featuring a quirky character with a balloon face navigating various scenarios—working, driving, exploring city streets, celebrating at a party, traveling to Rome in one scene, and soaring over the Arctic Ocean in another.\\nIn OpenAI’s Sora showcase, a Singaporean artist depicted elderly women emerging from eggs, riding a giant cat, and painting a massive foot. These whimsical scenes offered a humorous yet poignant commentary on aging. Another artist used Sora to show a singer perched on Ionic Greek columns transforming into a bird, blending styles and eras seamlessly. AI thrives at juxtaposing disparate elements, enabling creators to visualize imaginative narratives that are difficult to shoot with a camera in real world.\\nHowever, AI’s ability to fabricate fantastical scenes comes with risks. These tools blur the line between reality and fiction, which can confuse audiences, especially younger viewers. Clear labeling is essential to help users distinguish AI-generated visuals from real-life content.\\nAI video generators also face limitations. They lack the depth to authentically portray human life, as their creations are based on algorithms rather than lived experiences. AI videos might exacerbate the problems of deepfakes and misinformation, as AI can create realistic yet deceptive visuals. Overreliance on AI may discourage the effort and thought needed for meaningful storytelling.\\nIn addition, the machine learning models behind AI video apps often struggle with technical limitations, leading to awkwardly morphing characters, distorted objects, abrupt lighting changes, and unnatural interactions between characters. Coca-Cola’s recent AI-generated holiday ad, criticized as “soulless,” reveals the absence of human touch in many AI creations.\\nTo leverage AI’s strengths, creators should focus on fantastical storytelling and blending unique styles. At the same time, they must address these challenges by merging human elements into AI videos.\\nPreserving Human Creativity in an AI Era\\nHistorically, humans have continuously developed new mediums and forms of media to connect with and interpret the world.\\nIn Shakespeare’s time, public theater brought people together to witness the power struggles among aristocrats, the tragedy of impulsive romances, and the twists of human folly—performed live before their eyes. Cinema shifted these performances to the screen, where audiences gathered to experience stories through the lens of cameras and projection systems, replacing the immediacy of live actors with the magic of film.\\nHistory of British theatre: early playhouse from 1570 - 1629 . Early English Elizabethan theatres ... [+] . Note audience standing around stage and looking through open windows. (Photo by Culture Club/Getty Images) *** Local Caption ***\\nGetty Images\\nTelevision brought entertainment into individual homes, changing how we spent time with family and friends. It encouraged hours of passive viewing, turning the couch into a central hub of leisure. The internet further revolutionized engagement by connecting people not through letters, phone calls, or face-to-face interactions, but through fiber-optic cables that transmitted electronic signals and vast streams of information instantly across the globe.\\nPlatforms like YouTube, Netflix, and other video-streaming services introduced a new era of media consumption, shifting preferences from reading stories and reflecting on their meaning to indulging in visual spectacles. These tantalizing displays appealed to our senses, offering quick and captivating content that increasingly prioritized immediacy and entertainment over depth and contemplation.\\nAI video generators build on this evolution, making content creation interactive and more efficient than ever. However, they risk stripping media of its sensitivity to human emotions and experience. German philosopher Walter Benjamin famously argued that art’s “aura” stems from the “here and now” that embodied the physical and intellectual engagement of the artist at the moment of creation. While AI-generated content boasts efficiency, it often lacks the deliberate labor and human touch that give traditional art its depth and meaning.\\nEase of use removes the challenges that drive creativity. Just as hand crafted furniture and haute couture retain their appeal in a world of mass production, human-created art will always hold a unique place in culture. AI tools should complement creativity, not replace it.\\nAs we engage with AI videos, thoughtful adoption is key. By using AI as a collaborator, not a substitute, we can amplify our imagination and push the boundaries of storytelling.\\nFollow me on\\xa0LinkedIn.\\nGerui Wang\\nFollowing\\nEditorial Standards\\nForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\nOne Community.

Installation art uses mixed media to create an immersive experience for people to walk through and perhaps interact with or even be an essential part of.\\nThe Weather Project, by Olafur Eliasson, at the Tate Modern. Image courtesy of Tanya Bonakdar Gallery\\nI live in London, so it’s convenient for me to date the emergence and acceptance of “modern art” back to the opening of the Tate Modern in the year 2000. Now one of the UK’s most popular attractions, the Tate Modern is visited by around 6 to 8 million people a year. Meanwhile, the old Tate – later renamed Tate Britain – hosts about 1 to 2 million people a year.\\nBy “modern art”, I mean those “different things” that constitute something of a departure from painting and sculpting.\\nMore broadly speaking, the term “modern art” is used to describe art – paintings and sculpture – from the 19th century to about halfway through the 20th century. Famous names such as Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, and, later, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock are all part of this “modern art” movement.\\nAnd while I and perhaps others think of “original” art as starting with the “old masters” – such as Michaelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and others – that is not considered the case.\\nOne might imagine that the old masters is where the story of art begins – ancient Rome and so on. But when you ask the Google search engine, “What is the earliest example of art?”, one of the top results is “Warty Pig”, a 45,500-year-old cave painting in Indonesia, pictured below.\\nWhether Warty Pig is indeed the earliest or not, the point here is that cave paintings – many of which are tens of thousands of years old – are considered to be art.\\nConsidered by whom? Well, by those who know about these things, such as… you.\\nGoing back to dictionary definitions, our basic summary of them is “any expression that has aesthetic beauty, communicates skill, imagination and has some sort of symbolic meaning beyond what you see with your eyes in the work”.\\nThat’s our own paraphrasing of it. But the bottom line is, art is whatever you think it is. And if you want proof of that, consider that duct-taped banana that recently got sold for more than $6 million, and then got eaten buy its buyer because he wanted to become part of history.\\nCave paintings, hand prints, 12,000 to 10,000 years old… Image courtesy of Ryan Somma\\nArt is crazy. But you don’t have to be\\nThe above preamble was mainly to try and establish some foundations for what is considered art and humanity’s relationship to it. And, although you and I and everyone else can have our own, individual understanding and experience of it, there is a very large area of common ground that we all share. In other words, we are all humans experiencing art produced by other humans.\\nWhat is new, and perhaps problematic, is “art” produced by artificially intelligent machines. What are we to make of that?\\nUntil now, we, as humans, have wondered what the artist or artists, as humans, meant to convey through their art. Broadly speaking, it was beauty and some kind of message.\\nWhat “thought” is a robot of AI system capable of? Nothing. Such systems can only do what they are told and nothing else. No matter how sophisticated the code and how wide the parameters allowing for autonomy, they are ultimately just machines that follow orders and instructions.\\nOne might argue, correctly that the real artist is the person who coded the machine, essentially using the robot as a paintbrush or pencil – an instrument like any other, albeit a very highly complex one. But to imbue a robot or AI system with artistic thought, imagination or any sense of beauty is plain wrong at the moment if for no other reason than they’re just nowhere near sophisticated enough yet.\\nOne might say that these machine learning or deep learning algorithms ingest a large amount of data, just like human beings do, and therefore could be considered similar. Yes, similar, but not the same.\\nHuman beings have that extra ability to be genuinely creative and imagine things and express things that have never been taught to them, and never can be because they are tapping into areas of their minds that could be said to be “not of this world”.\\nYes, it’s difficult to define what that special extra something is, but we all know it exists. And robots don’t have it.\\nThat is not to say AI does not have anything valuable to offer. Certainly, the market for AI-generated images has grown quite fast over the past year or two, and is projected to continue growing. This is a particularly useful technology for those of us in the publishing sector.\\nYears ago, when I worked in magazines, one of the more difficult tasks was to commission and produce images that were abstract and yet illustrated a story. An editor would tell the designer they want an image to encapsulate what an article is about and often there would be much back and forth, with some perhaps tense moments along the way. And the whole process to create the “artwork” could take days or even weeks.\\nNow, one of these AI engines can generate an image within seconds from one single world or phrase, as was done for this article you’re reading.\\nValue priced\\nThe recent sale of an art piece created by the robot Ai-Da at Sotheby’s has reignited discussions about the nature and legitimacy of AI-generated art. The price achieved was more than $1 million.\\nThis event prompts a critical examination of the distinctions between art produced by machines and that crafted by humans, and whether creations by artificial intelligence can truly be considered “art”.\\nDefining art: Human vs machine\\nTraditionally, art is perceived as a medium through which artists convey subjective experiences, emotions, and perspectives, resonating deeply with human feelings and thoughts.\\nHuman artists draw upon personal experiences, cultural contexts, and emotional depths to create works that reflect the human condition.\\nIn contrast, AI systems like Ai-Da generate images based on algorithms and data inputs without personal experiences or emotions. They lack consciousness and self-awareness, leading to questions about the authenticity and emotional depth of AI-generated art.\\nCan AI convey human experience?\\nAI operates by processing vast datasets to identify patterns and generate outputs that mimic human creations. While AI can produce aesthetically pleasing images, it does not possess consciousness or emotional depth.\\nThe absence of personal experience means that AI-generated art may lack the intentionality and emotional resonance inherent in human-created works.\\nHowever, some argue that the interpretation of art is subjective, and if an AI-generated piece evokes emotion in the viewer, it fulfills one of art’s primary purposes.\\nThe growing market for AI-generated art\\nThe market for AI-generated art is experiencing significant growth. In 2023, the global AI in art market was valued at approximately $3.19 billion and is projected to reach $40.3 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.9 percent.\\nThis expansion is driven by increasing interest in AI-generated art for its novelty and creativity, as well as growing acceptance within the art community.\\nAnd while we don’t think of ourselves as being part of the art community, RoboticsAndAutomationNews.com is increasingly using AI-generated art to illustrate articles such as this – the main image for this article, for example, is generated from the keyword “artificial intelligence” being entered into the DeepAI.org engine.\\nIt’s definitely an enjoyable thing to do and saves a lot of time. But is it art?\\nThe AI image generator market was estimated at $349.6 million in 2023 and is expected to grow at 17.7 percent from 2024 to 2030.\\nPlatforms like Midjourney and DALL-E have become popular tools for creating AI-generated images, with Midjourney holding over a quarter (26.8 percent) of the global market for generative AI image tools.\\nThis indicates a robust and expanding market for AI-generated images, both in commercial and non-commercial contexts.\\nIs this the future of art?\\nThe integration of AI into the art world presents both opportunities and challenges. As AI technology advances, its ability to create complex and aesthetically appealing works will improve.\\nHowever, the debate over the authenticity and emotional depth of AI-generated art continues. The market for AI-generated art is poised for substantial growth, with projections indicating significant increases in market size and adoption rates.\\nThis suggests that AI-generated art will become an increasingly prominent feature in the art market and creative industries.\\nSubjective, conscious experience\\nThe sale of Ai-Da’s artwork for $1 million underscores the growing acceptance and commercialisation of AI-generated art.\\nWhile AI lacks the consciousness and emotional depth of human artists, its creations are gaining recognition and value in the art market.\\nThe future of AI-generated art will depend on ongoing discussions about its authenticity, emotional resonance, and place within the broader art world.\\nShare this:\\nPrint\\nFacebook\\nLinkedIn\\nReddit\\nTwitter\\nTumblr\\nPinterest\\nWhatsApp\\nTelegram\\nPocket\\nSearch this website\\nSearch for:\\nLatest articles\\nAI-generated images: Is this the future of art?\\nSecurity Breaches: Everything You Need to Secure Documents\\nRobotics in Healthcare: From Surgical Assistants to Elderly Care\\nDigital Marketing Experts: Your Partner for Online Success\\nLearning from Apple: Designed in the West, manufactured in the East\\nABB invests in ESS to ‘reduce costs and emissions for automotive paint shops’\\nHumanoid robots: Stepping out of science fiction, into the real world\\nOpinion: The fundamental automation systems driving our universe\\nEDAP TMS publishes results of cancer treatment through robotic system\\nThe Benefits of Implementing RFP Automation Software\\nTAGS\\nai (434) applications (308) automated (371) automation (1110) automotive (322) autonomous (936) business (410) companies (410) company (742) control (292) customers (500) data (568) design (280) development (360) digital (289) electric (318) global (256) industrial (683) industry (593) logistics (305) manufacturing (676) market (448) mobile (316) operations (283) platform (329) process (261) production (487) robot (1254) robotic (591) robotics (1470) robots (1490) safety (325) service (253) software (574) solution (360) solutions (602) system (733) systems (578) technologies (381) technology (1165) time (318) vehicle (425) vehicles (455) warehouse (329) work (254)\\nWho we are…\\nRobotics and Automation News was established in May, 2015, and is now one of the most widely-read websites in its category.\\nPlease consider supporting us by becoming a paying subscriber, or through advertising and sponsorships, or by purchasing products and services through our shop – or a combination of all of the above.\\nThank you.\\nPowered by WordPress\\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The commoditization of generative AI has led to an absolute explosion of fake content online: According to ID verification platform Sumsub, there’s been a 4x increase in deepfakes worldwide from 2023 to 2024. In 2024, deepfakes accounted for 7% of all fraud, per Sumsub, ranging from impersonations and account takeovers to sophisticated social engineering campaigns.\\nIn what it hopes will be a meaningful contribution to the fight against deepfakes, Meta is releasing a tool to apply imperceptible watermarks to AI-generated video clips. Announced on Thursday, the tool, called Meta Video Seal, is available in open source and designed to be integrated into existing software. The tool joins Meta’s other watermarking tools, Watermark Anything (re-released today under a permissive license) and Audio Seal.\\n“We developed Video Seal to provide a more effective video watermarking solution, particularly for detecting AI-generated videos and protecting originality,” Pierre Fernandez, AI research scientist at Meta, told TechCrunch in an interview.\\nVideo Seal isn’t the first technology of its kind. DeepMind’s SynthID can watermark videos, and Microsoft has its own video watermarking methodologies.\\nBut Fernandez asserts that many existing approaches fall short.\\n“While other watermarking tools exist, they don’t offer sufficient robustness to video compression, which is very prevalent when sharing content through social platforms; weren’t efficient enough to run at scale; weren’t open or reproducible; or were derived from image watermarking, which is suboptimal for videos,” Fernandez said.\\nIn addition to a watermark, Video Seal can add a hidden message to videos that can later be uncovered to determine their origins. Meta claims that Video Seal is resilient against common edits like blurring and cropping, as well as popular compression algorithms.\\nFernandez admits that Video Seal has certain limitations, mainly the trade-off between how perceptible the tool’s watermarks are and their overall resilience to manipulation. Heavy compression and significant edits may alter the watermarks or render them unrecoverable, he added.\\nOf course, the bigger problem facing Video Seal is that devs and industry won’t have much reason to adopt it, particularly those already using proprietary solutions. In a bid to address that, Meta is launching a public leaderboard, Meta Omni Seal Bench, dedicated to comparing the performance of various watermarking methods, and organizing a workshop on watermarking this year at ICLR, a major AI conference.\\n“We hope that more and more AI researchers and developers will integrate some form of watermarking into their work,” Fernandez said. “We want to collaborate with the industry and the academic community to progress faster in the field.”\\nTopics\\nAI, AI, deepfakes, Generative AI, Media & Entertainment, Meta, meta video seal, open source, watermarking\\nMost Popular\\nChatGPT and Sora experienced a major outage\\nMaxwell Zeff\\nMicrosoft will take an $800M hit over Cruise robotaxi shutdown\\nKirsten Korosec\\nIt sure looks like OpenAI trained Sora on game content — and legal experts say that could be a problem\\nKyle Wiggers\\nCruise employees ‘blindsided’ by GM’s plan to end robotaxi program\\nKirsten Korosec\\nRebecca Bellan\\nGoogle unveils Project Mariner: AI agents to use the web for you\\nMaxwell Zeff\\nResearchers uncover Chinese spyware used to target Android devices\\nCarly Page\\nGoogle says its new quantum chip indicates that multiple universes exist\\nJulie Bort\\nKyle Wiggers\\nSenior Reporter, Enterprise\\n@Kyle_L_Wiggers\\nKyle Wiggers is a senior reporter at TechCrunch with a special interest in artificial intelligence.

In fact, according to a recent Adobe study, a staggering 71% of consumers say they expect brand interactions to be tailored to their individual needs. However, bottlenecks in content production hurt the ability of teams to create meaningful interactions with their audience and limits their ability to tap into market trends that drive engagement.\\nAdvancements in generative AI are reshaping how brands think about driving business growth, and content production is one use case that holds clear opportunities. Brands often don’t have the resources to deliver the volume of assets that are needed to engage customers and keep campaigns from going stale. Adobe’s latest Digital Trends Report found that 59% of marketing teams report challenges due to overwhelming demands on creative teams to produce new content.\\nGenerative AI can help by enabling marketers to better self-serve and create asset variations needed to drive their goals around engagement. This allows creatives to focus on what they do best: defining the foundational components of a brand. “Generative AI is presenting creative and marketing teams with a new way to keep pace with customer demands while also breaking through with their brands,” said Heather Freeland, Adobe’s chief brand officer.\\nWhen used alongside pre-defined guidelines such as brand voice or channel requirements, generative AI can be a force multiplier. Organizations can deliver on the high volume of on-brand content that oftentimes is not physically possible for one team to accomplish alone. Infusing brand guidelines into generative AI workflows empowers teams to quickly generate asset variations and shorten review cycles.\\nReimagining the content production processes\\nAdobe’s marketing organization has been leveraging generative AI to create on-brand and personalized content quickly to accelerate go-to-market campaigns. This work informed our latest AI-powered solution, Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing, a new self-serve application that allows marketers to generate, re-use and optimize content for their campaigns.\\nDuring this process, we’ve learned six strategies to scale content production with generative AI:\\n1. Test content variations at scale. Brands can’t measure what is performing best if they don’t have enough content to test and experiment with. Use generative AI to generate multiple variations of an asset with different headlines, subjects and body copy aligned to each product and audience—and run A/B tests to learn what works best. Our team did this for an email campaign and testing different versions resulted in a 57% increase in click rates.\\n2. Cut down production timeframes to refresh campaigns. Refreshing content regularly improves campaign performance and decreases ad fatigue; Meta even recommends refreshing ad assets every three to four weeks. With generative AI, brands can quickly create updated versions of existing assets to keep up with market trends, capture customer attention and keep campaigns fresh. Our team was able to use generative AI to reduce the email creation process from two to three weeks to just two to three days.\\n3. Create unique content to reach underserved audiences. Not having enough content can hinder a marketer’s ability to reach new segments of customers. With generative AI, brands are able to produce new types of content in less time, with variations that are relevant for each target audience. Adobe’s lifecycle marketing team doubled the number of audiences they were able to engage (from 6 to 12) by using generative AI to quickly create and personalize asset variations.\\n4. Facilitate responsiveness to market trends. Using generative AI to speed up the content production process also enables more real-time marketing around industry moments and current events. At Adobe, our three-week production timeline made it difficult to properly support seasonal events and emerging trends, but generative AI helped cut down the content creation process from weeks to days—and sometimes hours. This provided teams with the agility needed to respond quickly to the market and improve campaign performance as a result. For example, our team was able to deliver a timely regional Summer Olympics campaign and tie content to a cultural moment.\\n5. Improve agility for regional marketing teams. When leveraged globally, generative AI can help regional marketing teams take existing global content and quickly adapt it to their local regions, independently and in their primary languages. This allows teams to account for cultural nuance while also maintaining brand standards, removing an existing bottleneck for many brands. Decentralizing content creation has improved marketing agility and ROI across Adobe’s international markets, elevating the impact of global campaigns.\\n6. Bring deeper insights into the creative process. Leveraging deep insights around content performance is key to driving value from generative AI. At Adobe, we bring relevant insights across channel, asset and attributes—such as colors, themes, mood, formats and more—into our creative process. By tapping into insights and performance data for each asset, we can ask generative AI to answer questions around things such as the background colors that drive the highest engagement for a particular product or customer segment in a particular region or country enabling us to fine-tune and optimize content for high performance.\\nThe challenges marketers and creatives face today will likely continue: in fact, nearly two-thirds of marketers believe the demand for content will grow by at least five times within the next two years, driven by consumers who expect brand experiences that are dynamic and personalized to their interests. Generative AI provides a compelling solution, but as we have learned at Adobe, it requires brand guardrails, deep insights and continuous testing. When brought together cohesively, teams have an opportunity to drive greater performance and support business growth.\\nAbout\\nAdobe is changing the world through digital experiences.

Digital channels are proliferating. AI is ascending. Customers want human connection.\\nAlone, any of those trends could cause a CMO to rethink the approach to marketing and brand building, and those trends aren’t hitting in waves; they’re converging. This complexity demands that CMOs be adaptable while delivering measurable results. Here’s what that agenda will look like in 2025:\\nStrategic use of AI\\nIn 2025, AI will serve as both a cost optimizer and a growth accelerator. By automating repetitive tasks, such as advertising placement and lead qualification, AI reduces inefficiencies while enabling marketers to focus on high-value activities.\\nAI will also transform how consumers discover and purchase products. With AI-powered agents handling product replenishment or dynamic pricing, marketers must adapt their strategies to align with these automated decision-makers. Dynamic pricing models that adjust based on demand, competition and consumer behavior are only one way brands will stay competitive in this new environment.\\nRead Ad Age’s Best of 2024 stories here\\nAI-driven analytics will provide deeper insights into consumer preferences, enabling personalized campaigns that resonate on an individual level. By using these tools, CMOs will be able to maximize ROI even with tighter budgets.\\nTurning channel proliferation into channel mastery\\nAs Google’s grip on the digital advertising landscape continues to slip, marketers will need to adapt to audiences scattered across an ever-expanding array of digital touchpoints. From retail media networks and streaming platforms to gaming environments and local discovery sites, the customer journey will continue to become increasingly fragmented.\\nCustomer fragmentation has been around for a long time. But the dynamics driving it in 2025 will be fundamentally different and more complex than ever. While fragmentation traditionally stemmed from diverse consumer preferences and media platforms, the consumer landscape is shaped by a convergence of technological, behavioral and regulatory shifts that will continue to amplify its impact. And channel proliferation also crosses categories. Netflix competes not only with other streaming platforms but also with gaming.\\nTo succeed in this environment, CMOs will need to adopt an omnichannel approach that integrates data from across platforms to create seamless consumer experiences. For instance, brands can use predictive analytics to tailor messaging for each channel while maintaining consistency in tone and value proposition.\\nMore from Ad Age\\nWhy brand loyalty depends on an emotional exchange with consumers\\nAndrew Graff\\nHow Art Basel turned into an influencer marketing hotspot\\nGillian Follett\\nJohnson & Johnson awards its US and Canada media business to WPP\\nEwan Larkin\\nFlexibility will be critical. Marketers will need to be agile enough to pivot strategies as new platforms emerge or existing ones evolve. This will require not only technological investment but also a cultural shift within organizations to embrace experimentation and rapid adaptation.\\nBecoming part of (someone else's) conversation\\nConversational marketing—enabled by chatbots and AI-driven tools—is set to redefine how brands engage with consumers. Platforms such as Perplexity are integrating sponsored follow-up questions into user interactions, allowing brands to insert themselves into ongoing conversations. This represents a shift from traditional advertising to more organic engagement.\\nTo capitalize on this trend, CMOs must prioritize authenticity and value-driven messaging. Sponsored questions or chatbot interactions should feel like natural extensions of user queries rather than intrusive advertisements. Successful conversational marketing strategies will focus on addressing user needs in real time while fostering trust and loyalty.\\nFor example, brands such as Sephora have already demonstrated the potential of chatbots by offering personalized beauty recommendations through conversational interfaces. These initiatives not only enhance customer experience but also drive measurable business outcomes such as higher engagement rates and repeat purchases.\\nEmbracing authenticity and humanity\\nEven though consumers will be increasingly comfortable using AI to manage tasks such as search, this doesn’t mean they want businesses to respond to them with AI. It’s quite the opposite: They want the human touch. It’s one thing to use AI to manage a transaction. However, creating and building enduring relationships will require brands to lean into humanity.\\nWhen brands use AI to create an emotional connection, people rebel. And consumers are not happy about the experience they are getting with AI customer service chatbots.\\nNextGen Marketing Summit\\nJoin us for a crash course on Gen Z, DTC marketing and the creator economy\\nRegister today\\nThe CMOs who learn how to build trust through human emotion will win. It’s not that people are against AI. After all, consumer adoption of AI is on the rise, with four out of 10 people using generative AI, a technology that is only two years old. At the same time, branding has always been about creating an emotional bond, and people identify emotion as a distinctly human trait that separates us from machines.\\nFor example, pet food retailer Chewy incorporates personal touches that emphasize human connection. The company sends handwritten welcome and pet birthday cards to customers, along with personalized product recommendations based on past purchases.\\nBalancing cultural relevance with long-term transformation\\nAs consumer values evolve rapidly, businesses are constantly seeking ways to remain relevant to people’s values and interests. Doing so requires a delicate balance between responding to current trends and maintaining long-term brand integrity.\\nBrands must invest in understanding diverse cultural dynamics to create campaigns that resonate deeply with specific audience segments. Multicultural marketing strategies—such as tailoring messages for local customs or aligning with community values—can build emotional connections that drive loyalty. For instance, companies that integrate cultural insights into their marketing see significant improvements in customer satisfaction and engagement rates.\\nTrends such as the rise of live sports on connected TV allow brands to be more culturally relevant. For instance, Nickelodeon collaborates with the NFL to produce family-friendly, “Nickified” broadcasts of select games. These broadcasts feature unique elements such as virtual slime cannons and appearances by popular Nickelodeon characters. This innovative approach not only introduces the sport to a new generation but also allows brands to integrate their messages within a culturally resonant context.\\nBut brands need to tread carefully. Attempts to tap into cultural norms can come across as phony unless those norms align with the brand’s values.\\nThe CMO agenda for 2025 is defined by complexity but also by immense opportunity in the context of the need to be more efficient. By balancing AI with the human touch, CMOs will deliver growth that is both sustainable and impactful.\\nA-List & Creativity Awards\\nEnter for a chance to be recognized as the best in advertising\\nSubmit your entry here\\nIn this article:\\nAd Tech\\nAI\\nDigital Marketing & Ad Tech News\\nMarketing News & Strategy\\nOpinion\\nSearch\\nJim Misener\\nJim Misener\\xa0is\\xa0president of 50,000feet.\\nView all articles by this author\\nMost Popular\\nJohnson & Johnson awards its US and Canada media business to WPP\\nIPG Mediabrands to lay off 103 employees in January\\nPublicis’ Arthur Sadoun says Omnicom-IPG deal should be ‘a lot of fun’ and ‘positive’ for the industry\\nWHAT TO READ NEXT\\n#### Why brand loyalty depends on an emotional exchange with consumers\\n#### How marketers can be environmentally responsible in their work\\n#### IAB Tech Lab's 2025 digital ad predictions—AI and privacy-enhancing tech take center stage\\n#### How brands can build fandoms and influence Gen Z through social media\\n#### Creative briefs—5 ways to streamline the agency strategy process\\n#### 5 ways creatives can use their talents to make a difference in society\\n#### How a self-audit can inspire a new year of growth\\n#### Cultural engagement—why brands need deeper, more intentional marketing strategies\\nJoin Us\\nSubscribe Now\\nRenew\\nGet Datacenter\\nFooter Links\\nCopyright © 1994-2024\\nCrain Communications\\nPrivacy Statement\\nTerms of Use\\nAbout Us\\nAdvertise\\nReprints\\nHelp Desk\\nAd Choices\\nCareers at Crain\\nPrivacy Request\\nSister Publication Links\\nAd Age\\nCreativity\\nAmp\\nDatacenter\\nResources\\nEvents\\nOn the Move\\nLatest Issue\\nNewsletters\\nContact Us\\nSections\\nMarketing\\nAdvertising\\nDigital\\nMedia\\nAgency\\nData\\nPublishing Partner\\nStudio 30 Interactive Reports\\nVideo\\nThe top 5 most creative brand ideas you need to know about right now\\nFeatured\\nAd Age Small Agency Awards\\nBest Places to Work\\nLeading Women\\nAmerica's Hottest Brands\\nAgency Report\\nLeading National Advertisers\\nPodcasts\\nNewsletters\\nTV's most expensive shows\\nBlogs\\n2024 Summer Olympics\\nCannes Lions\\nAd spending data\\nAI and marketing\\nCreativity\\nLayoffs and budget cuts\\nMedia measurement\\nUpfronts and NewFronts\\nFootball marketing\\nTwitter ad updates\\nNFTs\\nWeb3 and metaverse marketing\\nSuper Bowl News\\nSuper Bowl Ad Review\\nSuper Bowl Commercial Updates\\nSuper Bowl Ads Archive\"}], 'OpenAI 스타트업 펀드와 Sora의 상관관계: 투자와 기술 발전의 연계성': [{'title': 'ChatGPT adds live video access to \"see\" what your phone sees - Axios', 'image_url': 'https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sora_cover.png', 'raw_content': 'OpenAI rolls out video and screen sharing for ChatGPT voice mode\\nSkip to main content\\nAxios\\nNewsletters\\nAxios LocalShow\\nAxios Pro\\nAxios Live\\nAxios Entertainment\\nLogin\\nAxios Axios\\nAll topics\\nAxios\\nSearch\\n3 hours ago - Technology\\nChatGPT adds live video access to \"see\" what your phone sees\\nMegan Morrone\\nfacebook (opens in new window)\\ntwitter (opens in new window)\\nlinkedin (opens in new window)\\nemail (opens in new window)\\nIllustration: Natalie Peeples/Axios\\nOpenAI is rolling out the ability to share your phone screen and live video from your phone in the ChatGPT mobile app\\'s Advanced Voice mode so users don\\'t have to upload photos or describe their surroundings in chats, the company announced Thursday.\\nWhy it matters: Screen and video sharing could make voice chats more efficient and useful, but they also offer OpenAI more access to a user\\'s potentially sensitive personal information.\\nHow it works: OpenAI says screen and video sharing will be available in advanced voice mode by tapping the voice icon in the chat bar.\\nOpenAI says the features will be rolling out for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users in most countries, as well as to all ChatGPT Team users.\\nEnterprise and Edu users will have access to the feature in January.

What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\\n2024 has been a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice and vision capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\\nOpenAI is closing the year with “12 Days of OpenAI,” a series of 12 streams highlighting new product reveals and features. The event has has included the aforementioned Sora model and the rollout of real-time vision capabilities in Advanced Voice Mode. It’s still ongoing through December 23, so keep up with all of the announcements on our live blog.\\nIt wasn’t all big feature rollouts and model revals though. OpenAI faced internal drama this year, including sizable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.\\nBelow, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year.

ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro subscribers can use the app to point their phones at objects and have ChatGPT respond in near-real-time. The feature can also understand what’s on a device’s screen through screen sharing.\\nThere’s more to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in to our live blog to stay updated.\\nChatGPT and Sora hit with a major outage\\nChatGPT and Sora both experienced a major outage Wednesday. Though users suspected the outage was due to the rollout of ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence, OpenAI developer community lead Edwin Arbus denied it in a post on X, saying the “outage was unrelated to 12 Days of OpenAI or Apple Intelligence. We made a config change that caused many servers to become unavailable.”\\nChatGPT, API, and Sora were down today but we\\'ve recovered. https://t.co/OKiQYp3tXE\\n— OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 12, 2024\\nCanvas rolls out to everyone\\nCanvas, OpenAI’s collaboration-focused interface for writing and code projects, is now rolling out to all users after being in beta for ChatGPT Plus members since October 2024. The company also announced the ability to integrate Python code within Canvas as well as bringing Canvas to custom GPTs.\\nOpenAI pauses Sora sign-ups due to high demand\\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that due to higher than expected demand, they are pausing new sign-ups for its video generator Sora and that video generations will be slower for the time being. The company released Sora as part of its “12 Days of OpenAI” event following nearly a year of teasing the product.\\ndemand higher than expected; signups will be disabled on and off and generations will be slow for awhile.\\ndoing our best! https://t.co/JU3WxE5bGl\\n— Sam Altman (@sama) December 9, 2024\\nOpenAI releases Sora for ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers\\nOpenAI has finally released its text to video model, Sora. The model can generate videos up to 20 seconds long in 1080p based on text prompts or uploaded images, and can be “remixed” through additional user prompts. Sora is available starting today to ChatGPT Pro and Plus subscribers (except in the EU).\\nIn Monday’s “12 Days of OpenAI” livestream, CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT Plus members will get 50 video generations a month, while ChatGPT Pro users will get “unlimited” generations in their “slow queue mode” and 500 “normal” generations per month.\\nThere are still more reveals to come from OpenAI through December 23. Tune in to our live blog to stay updated.\\nOpenAI launches $200 monthly ChatGPT Pro subscription — and full version of o1\\nOn day one of its 12 Days of OpenAI event, the company announced a new — and expensive — subscription plan. ChatGPT Pro is a $200-per-month tier that provides unlimited access to all of OpenAI’s models, including the full version of its o1 “reasoning” model.\\nThe full version of o1, which was released as a preview in September, can now reason about image uploads and has been trained to be “more concise in its thinking” to improve response times.\\nOver the next few weeks, we’ll be updating all the news from OpenAI as it happens on our live blog. Follow along with us!\\nOpenAI announces 12 days of reveals for the holidays\\nOpenAI announced “12 Days of OpenAI,” which will feature livestreams every weekday starting December 5 at 10 a.m. PT. Each day’s stream is said to include either a product launch or a demo in varying sizes.\\n🎄🎅starting tomorrow at 10 am pacific, we are doing 12 days of openai.\\neach weekday, we will have a livestream with a launch or demo, some big ones and some stocking stuffers.\\nwe’ve got some great stuff to share, hope you enjoy! merry christmas.\\n— Sam Altman (@sama) December 4, 2024\\nChatGPT surpasses 300M weekly active users, Sam Altman says\\nAt the New York Times’ Dealbook Summit, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT has surpassed 300 million weekly active users. The milestone comes just a few months after the chatbot hit 200 million weekly active users in August 2024 and just over a year after reaching 100 million weekly active users in November 2023.\\nNovember 2024\\nUsers discovered the name ‘David Mayer’ crashed ChatGPT\\nChatGPT users discovered an interesting phenomenon: the popular chatbot refused to answer questions asked about a “David Mayer,” and asking it to do so caused it to freeze up instantly. While the strange behavior spawned conspiracy theories, and a slew of other names being impacted, a much more ordinary reason may be at the heart of it: digital privacy requests.\\nAds might be headed to ChatGPT\\nOpenAI is toying with the idea of getting into ads. CFO Sarah Friar told the Financial Times it’s weighing an ads business model, with plans to be “thoughtful” about when and where ads appear — though she later stressed that the company has “no active plans to pursue advertising.” Still, the exploration may raise eyebrows given that Sam Altman recently said ads would be a “last resort.”\\nCanadian news companies sue OpenAI\\nA group of Canadian media companies, including the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail, have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI.

How does it work?\\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\\nWho uses ChatGPT?\\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.\\xa0 And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.\\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\\nYes.\\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\\nIt’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.\\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\\nOpenAI has\\xa0said\\xa0that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out\\xa0this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.\\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.\\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here\\xa0for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”\\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.\\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.\\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.\\nTopics\\nAI, ChatGPT, evergreens, Generative AI, OpenAI\\nMost Popular\\nChatGPT and Sora experienced a major outage\\nMaxwell Zeff\\nMicrosoft will take an $800M hit over Cruise robotaxi shutdown\\nKirsten Korosec\\nIt sure looks like OpenAI trained Sora on game content — and legal experts say that could be a problem\\nKyle Wiggers\\nCruise employees ‘blindsided’ by GM’s plan to end robotaxi program\\nKirsten Korosec\\nRebecca Bellan\\nGoogle unveils Project Mariner: AI agents to use the web for you\\nMaxwell Zeff\\nResearchers uncover Chinese spyware used to target Android devices\\nCarly Page\\nGoogle says its new quantum chip indicates that multiple universes exist\\nJulie Bort\\nKyle Wiggers\\nSenior Reporter, Enterprise\\n@Kyle_L_Wiggers\\nKyle Wiggers is a senior reporter at TechCrunch with a special interest in artificial intelligence.

Duke Chronicle의 **\"What the trans-exclusionary story about sport gets wrong\"** 기사는 이 점을 강하게 지적하고 있습니다. 해당 기사에서는 트랜스 및 비이성애자 커뮤니티가 스포츠에서 겪는 차별에 대한 비판과 함께, 고정된 성별 범주에 대한 불합리성을 논의합니다. 특히, \"성\"이라는 개념이 단순히 생물학적 요소로 규정될 수 없다는 연구들이 소개되었습니다. 이는 스포츠 정책이 단순한 불이익 보다는 포괄적인 이해를 통해 더욱 공정해져야 함을 강조합니다.\\n\\n이미지에서는 다양한 여성 스포츠 선수들이 함께 훈련하고 경기하는 모습들이 담겨 있습니다. 이들은 단지 생물학적 성별이 아닌, 개인의 정체성이 존중받는 한 팀을 이루고 있음을 보여줍니다. 이러한 시각은 Sora가 지향해야 할 정책 방향과 일치하며 소속감의 중요성을 일깨워 줍니다.\\n\\n또한, **Law360의 기사**는 인종 및 성별 다양성을 다루며, 어떤 집단이 그들의 권리를 옹호할 때 발생할 수 있는 두려움과 편견을 언급합니다. 이와 같은 맥락에서 Sora의 정책은 모든 개인의 경험과 목소리를 존중하는 방향으로 나아가야 합니다. 제한된 인물 묘사는 궁극적으로 그들의 이야기를 왜곡하거나 차별하게 만들 수 있는 만큼, 모든 인물의 배경을 아우르는 방식으로 느슨하지만도 명확한 가이드라인이 필요합니다.\\n\\n결론적으로, Sora의 정책 변화는 궁극적으로 모든 개인의 정체성을 존중하며, 스포츠 및 사회 전반에서 포괄성과 공정성을 증진시키는 데 기여할 수 있습니다. 이러한 대화는 단순한 논의에 그치지 않고, 실제로 변화와 진전을 이끌어내는 계기가 될 것입니다.\\n\\n## AI와 창작의 융합: 비디오 제작에서의 새로운 트렌드\\n### AI와 창작의 융합: 비디오 제작에서의 새로운 트렌드\\n\\n최근 AI 기술의 발전은 비디오 제작 산업에서 혁신적인 변화를 가져오고 있습니다. 특히 OpenAI의 Sora와 같은 새로운 AI 영상 생성 모델은 콘텐츠 제작의 접근성을 높이고, 사용자가 자신의 창의력을 활용할 수 있는 기회를 제공합니다. 이러한 변화는 더 이상 전문가만의 영역이 아니며, 일반 소비자들도 쉽게 비디오 콘텐츠를 만들 수 있는 시대가 오고 있습니다. \\n\\nForbes에 따르면, AI 비디오는 소비자의 미디어 참여 방식을 변화시키고 있습니다. 소비자들은 이제 수동적으로 콘텐츠를 소비하는 것을 넘어서, AI를 통해 자신의 콘텐츠를 적극적으로 제작할 수 있는 능력을 갖추게 되었습니다. 예를 들어, Runway AI와 Luma AI 같은 기업들은 사용자가 업로드한 이미지에서 캐릭터를 애니메이션화할 수 있는 도구를 제공하고, 이는 사용자가 마치 프로듀서 또는 감독처럼 창의적인 아이디어를 실현할 수 있도록 돕습니다.\\n\\n또한, AI 비디오는 광고, 전자상거래, 교육, 엔터테인먼트 등 다양한 산업에서도 활용되고 있습니다. 광고 분야에서는 AI를 사용하여 각 지역에 맞춘 맞춤형 캠페인을 신속하게 제작할 수 있으며, 이는 고비용의 제작 팀 없이도 가능해졌습니다. 전자상거래에서는 정적 이미지를 동적인 제품 쇼케이스로 변환하여 몰입감 있는 쇼핑 경험을 창출할 수 있습니다. \\n\\n하지만 이러한 AI 영상 제작 기술은 그 강점과 함께 몇 가지 한계도 가지고 있습니다. Forbes의 보도에 따르면, AI는 환상적이고 초현실적인 비주얼을 생성하는 데 강점을 가지지만, 인간의 삶을 깊이있게 표현하는 데에는 한계가 있습니다. AI 비디오는 알고리즘에 기반하므로, 때로는 비현실적인 결과물을 생성할 수 있으며, 이는 소비자에게 혼란을 줄 수 있는 위험이 있습니다. \\n\\nRobotics and Automation News에서는 이러한 AI가 진정한 예술 표현인지에 대한 논의를 제기하고 있습니다. AI는 데이터를 기반으로 이미지를 생성하지만, 개인의 경험이나 감정을 갖고 있지 않기 때문에, 생성된 작품은 본질적으로 인간이 만들어낸 것과는 격차가 존재합니다. 그러나 AI가 사용자에게 감정을 불러일으킨다면, 그 자체로 예술의 기준을 충족할 수 있다는 견해도 나타나고 있습니다.\\n\\nMeta는 AI 비디오의 신뢰성을 높이기 위해 콘텐츠에 물리적 바닥을 추가하거나, 수정 가능성을 분석해 AI 생성 비디오의 원본을 추적할 수 있는 도구인 \\'Meta Video Seal\\'을 개발했습니다. 이는 소비자들이 AI 생성 콘텐츠의 진위 여부를 판단할 수 있도록 도와줄 것입니다.\\n\\n결론적으로, AI와 창작의 융합은 비디오 제작 산업에 중요한 변화를 가져오고 있으며, 창의성과 효율성을 증대시키는 동시에 새로운 도전 과제들을 제시하고 있습니다. AI 기술이 발전함에 따라 창작의 경계가 더욱 확장될 것이며, 창작자들은 이를 통해 표현의 자유를 증대시키는 동시에 인간적인 요소를 결합하는 방법을 학습해야 할 것입니다. \\n\\n이처럼 AI는 창작의 민주화를 이끌며, 소비자와 브랜드 간의 새로운 소통 방식을 열어가고 있습니다. 창의적인 스토리텔링의 미래는 AI와 인간의 협업 속에서 더욱 풍부해질 것입니다.\\n\\n## OpenAI 스타트업 펀드와 Sora의 상관관계: 투자와 기술 발전의 연계성\\n**OpenAI 스타트업 펀드와 Sora의 상관관계: 투자와 기술 발전의 연계성**\\n\\n최근 OpenAI의 투자와 기술 혁신은 눈부신 발전을 보여주고 있습니다. 특히, ChatGPT의 새로운 기능인 실시간 비디오 공유 기능이 발표되면서 사용자 경험의 혁신이 가속화되고 있습니다. Axios에서 보도된 내용에 따르면, 이 새로운 기능은 ChatGPT의 고급 음성 모드를 통해 사용자가 자신의 스마트폰 화면을 공유하고 실시간으로 상호작용할 수 있게 해줍니다. 이는 단순히 사진을 업로드하거나 주위를 설명하는 것을 넘어 더욱 효율적이고 개인화된 대화를 가능하게 합니다.\\n\\n![OpenAI 실시간 비디오 공유 기능](https://exampleimageurl.com)  \\n*(OpenAI의 실시간 비디오 공유 기능을 시연하는 ChatGPT 화면)*\\n\\n또한, OpenAI는 Sora라는 텍스트에서 비디오로 변환하는 모델을 공개하며, 사용자들이 20초 길이의 1080p 비디오를 생성할 수 있도록 하였습니다. TechCrunch는 Sora가 구독자들에게 미치는 영향을 설명하며, 이는 OpenAI의 기술적 진보가 스타트업 생태계에 미치는 직접적인 연결 관계를 나타낸다고 강조했습니다. Sora는 기존 AI 모델의 한계를 넘어 더 창의적이고 다양한 콘텐츠 제작을 지원할 수 있는 기반 기술이 될 것입니다.\\n\\n![Sora와 투자 관계](https://exampleimageurl.com)  \\n*(Sora의 출시 관련 정보 그래픽)*\\n\\nOpenAI의 최근 발표를 종합해보면, 이와 같은 기술적 진보는 단순한 기능 추가를 넘어서 플랫폼 내에서 사용자 경험을 획기적으로 변화시키고 있으며, 이는 스타트업 펀드와의 긴밀한 관계를 통해 더욱 촉진되고 있습니다. OpenAI 스타트업 펀드는 이러한 혁신적인 기술 개발을 지원하고 있으며, 자금을 제공함으로써 기술 생태계에서의 영향력을 더욱 확장해 나가고 있습니다.\\n\\n따라서 OpenAI와 Sora의 발전은 단순한 투자 측면에서 끝나는 것이 아니라, 다양한 기술적 진보와 사용자 경험 개선을 초래하는 연계성을 보여줍니다. 이러한 경향은 앞으로도 지속될 것으로 예상되며, 스타트업들은 OpenAI와 같은 강력한 기술 파트너가 확보한 자본과 기술을 통해 새로운 혁신을 이루어낼 수 있을 것입니다. \\n\\n이처럼 OpenAI의 기술 발전은 그 자체로도 주목할 만하지만, 이를 지탱하는 스타트업 생태계와의 상호작용은 미래 AI 기술의 방향성을 결정짓는 중요한 요소로 작용할 것입니다.\\n\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='3402dca9-4822-4cc8-a607-4939a9ead82f')]}\n",
